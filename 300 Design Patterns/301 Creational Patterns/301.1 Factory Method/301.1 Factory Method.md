![[Pasted image 20230520223102.png | center]]

The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an <span style="color:#81fd83">interface for creating objects</span> in a base class.

- Allows <span style="color:#81fd83">subclasses</span> to <span style="color:#81fd83">alter</span> the type of <span style="color:#81fd83">objects</span> created

> [!warning] 
> ## Problem: 

![[Pasted image 20230520223730.png | center]]

Imagine that you are creating a <span style="color:#81fd83">logistic management application</span>.

- <span style="color:#81fd83">Version 1</span>: The application can only handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of the code lives inside the <span style="color:#81fd83">Truck Class</span>.

After a while, your app becomes pretty popular. Each day you receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies to incorporate <span style="color:#ffff00">sea logistics</span> into the app.

- Most of your code is coupled to the Truck Class. 
- Adding Ships would require making changed to the entire codebase.

The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls with calls to a special factory method. Those objects are commons referred to as products.

> [!question] 
>  At first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the program to another. 

However, consider this: now you can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method

There's a slight limitation:

- Subclasses may return different types of products if implementing a common base class or interface.

![[Pasted image 20230520230429.png | center]]


Each class implements this method differently: trucks deliver cargo by land, ships deliver cargo by sea. 

- RoadLogistics() : Truck object
- SeaLogistics() : Ship object

The Factory Method separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product. Therefore it’s easier to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the code.

>  Use the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time

You often experience this need when dealing with large, resource-intensive objects such as database connections, file systems, and network resources.

Let’s think about what has to be done to reuse an existing object:

1. First, you need to create some storage to keep track of all of the created objects.
2. When someone requests an object, the program should look for a free object inside that pool.
3. ... and then return it to the client code.
4. If there are no free objects, the program should create a new one (and add it to the pool).

That’s a lot of code! And it must all be put into a single place so that you don’t pollute the program with duplicate code.

Probably the most obvious and convenient place where this code could be placed is the constructor of the class whose objects we’re trying to reuse. However, a constructor must always return **new objects** by definition. It can’t return existing instances.

Therefore, you need to have a regular method capable of creating new objects as well as reusing existing ones.


> [!summary] 
> # Pros and Cons 

<span style="color:#81fd83">Pros</span>:

- The overall complexity of the code increases since the pattern requires creating multiple new classes.
- _Single Responsibility Principle_. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.
- _Open/Closed Principle_. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.
  
<span style="color:#ff4d4d">Cons</span>:

- The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern. The best case scenario is when you’re introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.

``` run-csharp
public interface IProduct
{
	string Operation();
}
```


``` run-csharp 
abstract class Creator
{
	public abstract IProduct FactoryMethod;
	
	public string SomeOperation()
	{
		var product = FactoryMethod();
		var result = "Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with " + product.Operation();
		
		return result;
	}
}
```


``` run-csharp
public class ConcreteCreator1 : Creator
{
	public override IProduct FactoryMethod()
	{
		return new ConcreteProduct1();
	}
}
```


``` run-csharp
public class ConcreteCreator2 : Creator
{
	public override IProduct FactoryMethod()
	{
		return new ConcreteProduct2();
	}
}
```


``` run-csharp
public class ConcreteProduct1 : IProduct
{
	public string Operation()
	{
		return "{Result of ConcreteProduct1}";
	}
}
```


``` run-csharp
public class ConcreteProduct2 : IProduct
{
	public string Operation()
	{
		return "{Result of ConcreteProduct2}";
	}
}
```


``` run-csharp
public class Client
{
	public void Main()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator1.")
		ClientCode(new ConcreteCreator1());
		
		Console.WriteLine("App: Launched with the ConcreteCreator2.")
		ClientCode(new ConcreteCreator2());
	}
	
	public void ClientCode(Creator creator)
	{
		// ...
		Console.WriteLine("Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works.\n" + creator.SomeOperation());
	}
}
```


``` run-csharp
public class Program
{
	public static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		new Client.Main();
	}
}
```
