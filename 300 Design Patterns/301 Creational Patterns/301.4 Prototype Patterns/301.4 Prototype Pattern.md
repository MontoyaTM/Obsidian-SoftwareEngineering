<span style="color:#81fd83">Prototype</span> is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.


> [!warning] 
> ## Problem: 

Say you have an object, and you want to create an exact copy of it. How would you do it?

- Create a new object of the same class, going over all the fields of the original object and copy their values.

However, not all objects fields are public or visible from outside the object itself.

Another problem with the direct approach; the code become dependent on the class.


> [!success] 
> ## Solution: 

The Prototype pattern <span style="color:#81fd83">delegates</span> the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned. The pattern declares a common interface for all objects that support cloning.

- Interface clones an object without coupling the code to the class of the object. `Clone() method`

The implementation of all the Clone() method is very similar in all classes.

- Methods creates an object of the current class and carries over all of the field value of the old object into the new one.


> [!hint] 
>  An object that supports cloning is called a _prototype_. When your objects have dozens of fields and hundreds of possible configurations, cloning them might serve as an alternative to subclassing.

Prototypes allow for copying of private fields because most programming languages let objects access private field of other objects that belong to the same class.

>  Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldn’t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.

This happens a lot when your code works with objects passed to you from 3rd-party code via some interface. The concrete classes of these objects are unknown, and you couldn’t depend on them even if you wanted to.

The Prototype pattern provides the client code with a general interface for working with all objects that support cloning. This interface makes the client code independent from the concrete classes of objects that it clones.


> [!bug] 
>  Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their respective objects.

The Prototype pattern lets you use a set of pre-built objects configured in various ways as prototypes. Instead of instantiating a subclass that matches some configuration, the client can simply look for an appropriate prototype and clone it.


> [!summary] 
> # Pros and Cons 

Pros:

- You can clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes.
-  You can get rid of repeated initialization code in favor of cloning pre-built prototypes.
-  You can produce complex objects more conveniently.
-  You get an alternative to inheritance when dealing with configuration presets for complex objects.


Cons:

- Cloning complex objects that have circular references might be very tricky.
