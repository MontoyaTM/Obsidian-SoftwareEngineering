![[Pasted image 20230520223102.png]]

<font style="color:#b562f9">Factory Method</font> is a creational design pattern that provides an <font style="color:#81fd83">interface for creating objects</font> in a <font style="color:#b562f9">superclass</font>, but allows <font style="color:#fd9bd4">subclasses</font> to <font style="color:#fd9bd4">alter</font> the type of objects that will be created.

> [!warning] 
> ## Problem: 

Imagine that you’re creating a <font style="color:#b562f9">logistics management application</font>. The first version of your app can only handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of your code lives inside the <font style="color:#81fd83">Truck class</font>.

After a while, your app becomes pretty popular. Each day you receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies to incorporate <font style="color:#47fff3">sea logistics</font> into the app.

Great news, right? But how about the code? At present, most of your code is coupled to the <font style="color:#b562f9">Truck</font> class. Adding <font style="color:#b562f9">Ships</font> into the app would require making changes to the entire codebase. Moreover, if later you decide to add another type of transportation to the app, you will probably need to make all of these changes again.

> ## Solution: 

The <font style="color:#b562f9">Factory Method</font> pattern suggests that you <font style="color:#dd68fd">replace</font> direct <font style="color:#dd68fd">object construction</font> calls (using the new operator) with calls to a <font style="color:#81fd83">special factory method</font>. 

Don’t worry: the objects are still created via the new operator, but it’s being <font style="color:#b562f9">called</font> from within the <font style="color:#b562f9">factory method</font>. Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as <font style="color:#e493fb">products</font>.

At first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the program to another. However, consider this: now you can <font style="color:#b562f9">override</font> the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method.

There’s a slight <font style="color:#b562f9">limitation</font> though: <font style="color:#81fd83">subclasses</font> may <font style="color:#81fd83">return</font> different <font style="color:#81fd83">types</font> of products only if these products have a common base class or interface. Also, the factory method in the base class should have its return type declared as this interface.

![[Pasted image 20230520225557.png]]

For example, both <font style="color:#b562f9">Truck</font> and <font style="color:#b562f9">Ship</font> classes should implement the <font style="color:#b562f9">Transport interface</font>, which declares a method called <font style="color:#81fd83">deliver</font>. 

Each class implements this method differently: trucks deliver cargo by land, ships deliver cargo by sea. The factory method in the <font style="color:#b562f9">RoadLogistics</font> class returns <font style="color:#81fd83">truck</font> objects, whereas the factory method in the <font style="color:#b562f9">SeaLogistics</font> class returns <font style="color:#81fd83">ships</font>.

![[Pasted image 20230520230525.png]]


#### 1. Product:

The <font style="color:#b562f9">Product</font> declares the interface, which is common to all objects that can be produced by the creator and its subclasses.

#### 2. Concrete Product:

<font style="color:#b562f9">Concrete Products </font>are different implementations of the product interface.

#### 3. Creator

The <font style="color:#b562f9">Creator</font> class declares the factory method that returns new product objects. It’s important that the return type of this method matches the product interface.

You can declare the factory method as <font style="color:#b562f9">abstract</font> to force all subclasses to implement their own versions of the method. As an alternative, the base factory method can return some default product type.

#### 4. Concrete Creator

<font style="color:#b562f9">Concrete Creators</font> override the base factory method so it returns a different type of product.
