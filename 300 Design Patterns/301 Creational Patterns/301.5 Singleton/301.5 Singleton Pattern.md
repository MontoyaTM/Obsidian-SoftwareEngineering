<span style="color:#81fd83">Singleton</span> is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the _Single Responsibility Principle_:

1. Ensures that a class has a <span style="color:#81fd83">single instance</span>. 

The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resource; database, file. Imagine that you created an object, but after a while decided to create a new one. Instead of receiving a fresh object, you’ll get the one you already created.

*Note that this behavior is impossible to implement with a regular constructor since a constructor call **must** always return a new object by design.*


2. **Provide a <span style="color:#81fd83">global access point</span> to that instance**.

Just like a global variable, the Singleton pattern lets you access some object from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects that instance from being overwritten by other code.

> ## Solution: 

All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:

- Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the `new` operator with the Singleton class.
- Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.

The Singleton pattern disables all other means of creating objects of a class except for the special creation method. This method either creates a new object or returns an existing one if it has already been created.

Unlike global variables, the Singleton pattern guarantees that there's just one instance of a class. Nothing, except for the Singleton class itself, can be replace the cached instance.

*Note: You can adjust the limitations and allow creating any number of Singleton instance. However the code for the getInstance method must be modified to allow for multiple instances.*


> [!summary] 
> # Pros and Cons 


### Pros:

- Ensure that a class has only a single instance
- Global access to that point
- Singleton object is initialized only when it is requested

### Cons:

- Violates the Single Responsibility Principle. 
- Singleton Pattern can mask bad design; components know too much about each other.
- Requires special treatment in a multithreaded environment to prevent multiple Singleton object in multiple thhreads.
- Difficult to unit test code of a Singleton.
