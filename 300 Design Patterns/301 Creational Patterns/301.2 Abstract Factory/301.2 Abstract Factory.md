<span style="color:#81fd83">Abstract Factory</span> is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

> [!warning] 
> ## Problem: 

Imagine that you're creating a furniture shop simulator.

- A family of related products: `Chair`, `Sofa`, `CofeeTable`
- Several variants: `Art Deco`, `Victorian`, `Modern`

![[Pasted image 20240612172820.png | center]]

You need a way to create individual furniture objects so that they match other objects of the same family.

![[Pasted image 20240612173311.png | center]]

Also, you don’t want to change existing code when adding new products or families of products to the program. Furniture vendors update their catalogs very often, and you wouldn’t want to change the core code each time it happens.


> [!success] 
> ## Solution: 

The Abstract Factory pattern suggests that you explicitly declare interfaces for each distinct product of the product family. 

- All variants of products follow those interfaces.

<span style="color:#81fd83">Declare</span> the Abstract Factory:

- <span style="color:#81fd83">Interface</span>: List of creation methods for all products that are part of a family.

For each variant of a product family, we create a separate factory class based on the `AbstractFactory` interface. A factory is a class that returns products of a particular kind.

![[Pasted image 20240612175534.png | center | 700]]

The client code has to work with both factories and products via their respective abstract interfaces. 

- Allows for changing of factory type passed to the client code and product variant

Client wants a factory to produce a chair:

- Client doesn't have to be aware of the factory's class nor does it matter the kind of chair it gets. (Client treats all chairs in the same manner using the <span style="color:#81fd83">abstract chair interface</span>)

> [!bug] 
>  Use the Abstract Factory when your code needs to work with various families of related products, but you don’t want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products—they might be unknown beforehand or you simply want to allow for future extensibility.

The Abstract Factory provides you with an interface for creating objects from each class of the product family. As long as your code creates objects via this interface, you don’t have to worry about creating the wrong variant of a product which doesn’t match the products already created by your app.


> [!bug] 
> Consider implementing the Abstract Factory when you have a class with a set of Factory Methods that blur its primary responsibility. 

 In a well-designed program _each class is responsible only for one thing_. When a class deals with multiple product types, it may be worth extracting its factory methods into a stand-alone factory class or a full-blown Abstract Factory implementation.


> [!summary] 
> # Pros and Cons 

Pros:

- You can be sure that the products you’re getting from a factory are compatible with each other.
-  You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.
-  _Single Responsibility Principle_. You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier to support.
-  _Open/Closed Principle_. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.

Con:
- The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.

``` run-csharp
public interface IPlant
{
	string Grow();
}
```

``` run-csharp
public class Potato : IPlant
{
	public string Grow()
	{
		return "Growing a potato.";
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public class Tomato : IPlant
{
	public string Grow()
	{
		return "Growing a tomato."
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public interface IAnimal
{
	string Feed();
}
```

``` run-csharp
public class Cow : IAnimal
{
	public string Feed()
	{
		return "Feeding a cow.";
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public class Chicken : IAnimal
{
	public string Feed()
	{
		return "Feeding a chicken.";
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public interface IFarmFactory
{
	IPlant CreatePlant();
	IAnimal CreateAnimal();
}
```

``` run-csharp
public class VegatableFarm : IFarmFactory
{
	public IPlant CreatePlant()
	{
		return new Potato();
	}
	
	public IAnimal CreateAnimal()
	{
		return new Cow();
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public class PoultryFarm : IFarmFactory
{
	public IPlant CreatePlant()
	{
		return new Tomato();
	}
	
	public IAnimal CreateAnimal()
	{
		return new Chicken();
	}
}
```

---

``` run-csharp
public class Farmer
{
	public Farmer(IFarmFactory factory)
	{
		IPlant plant = factory.CreatePlant();
		Console.WriteLine("plant.Grow()")
		
		IAnimal animal = factory.CreateAnimal();
		Console.WriteLine("animal.Feed()");
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public class Program
{
	public class Main(string[] args)
	{
		new Farmer(new VegetableFarm());
		new Farmer(new PoultryFarm());
	}
}
```
