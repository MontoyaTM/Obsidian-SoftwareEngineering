The <span style="color:#81fd83">Builder Pattern</span> is a creational design pattern that allows for <span style="color:#81fd83">creation</span> of complex object <span style="color:#81fd83">step by step</span>.

- Allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.


> [!warning] 
> ## Problem: 

![[Pasted image 20240605230105.png | center | 650]]

Imagine a complex object that requires laborious, step-by-step initialization of many fields and nested objects. Since initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters or scattered all over the client code.


<span style="color:#81fd83">House</span>:

For example, imagine how you would create a House object.

- Walls
- Floor
- Doors
- Windows
- Roof

<span style="color:#81fd83">Better House</span>:

- Backyard
- Heating
- Cooling
- Plumbing
- Electrical

The simplest solution is to extend the base House Class and create a set of subclasses to cover all combinations of the parameters. However, the number of subclasses will grow considerably.

Another solution that avoids breeding subclasses is by creating a giant constructor in the House Class with all possible parameters. However, it creates another problem; many parameter will go unused.

The <span style="color:#81fd83">Builder Pattern</span> suggests that you <span style="color:#81fd83">extract the object construction code</span> out of its own class and move it to a separate object called <span style="color:#81fd83">builders</span>. To create an object, you execute a series of these steps on a builder object by only calling hose steps that are necessary for the configuration. Some of the construction steps might require different implementation when you need to build various representations of the product.

<span style="color:#81fd83">Director</span>:

You can further extract a series of calls to the builder steps you use to construct a product into a separate class called <span style="color:#81fd83">director</span>. However, it is not strictly necessary but it allows for a good place to put various construction routines.

- Hides the details of product construction from the client code.

>  Use the Builder Pattern to get rid of a "telescoping constructor".

Say you have a constructor with ten optional parameters. Call the constructor is very inconvenient; therefore, you overload the constructor and create several shorter versions with fewer parameters. The Builder pattern lets you build objects step by step, using only those steps that you really need. After implementing the pattern, you don’t have to cram dozens of parameters into your constructors anymore.

``` run-csharp
class Pizza {
    Pizza(int size) { ... }
    Pizza(int size, boolean cheese) { ... }
    Pizza(int size, boolean cheese, boolean pepperoni) { ... }
```


> [!bug] 
> Use the Builder Pattern when you want you code to be able to create different representations of some product (stone & wooden houses).

The Builder pattern lets you construct products step-by-step. You could defer execution of some steps without breaking the final product. You can even call steps recursively, which comes in handy when you need to build an object tree.


> [!summary] 
> # Pros and Cons 

<span style="color:#81fd83">Pros</span>:

- You can construct objects step-by-step, defer construction steps or run steps recursively.
- You can reuse the same construction code when building various representations of products.
- _Single Responsibility Principle_. You can isolate complex construction code from the business logic of the product.

<span style="color:#ff4d4d">Cons</span>:

- The overall complexity of the code increases since the pattern requires creating multiple new classes.
