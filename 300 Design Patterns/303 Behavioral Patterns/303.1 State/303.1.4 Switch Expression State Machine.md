Switch Expression State Machine is a type of State Design Pattern that uses C# 8's switch expression to define state and transition properties.

## State

Within any unique state, the program behaves differently, and the program can be switched from one state to another instantaneously. However, depending on a current state, the program may or may not switch to certain other states.

![[303.1.4 Switch Expression — State.svg| 300]]

``` run-csharp
public enum State
{
	Open,
	Closed,
	Locked
}
```

## Action

Within any unique state, the program behaves differently, and the program can be switched from one state to another instantaneously. However, depending on a current state, the program may or may not switch to certain other states.

![[303.1.4 Switch Expression — Action.svg| 300]]

``` run-csharp
public enum Action
{
	Open,
	Close
}
```

## Chest

These switching rules, called _transitions_, are also finite and predetermined. To transition the context into another state, replace the active state object with another object that represents that new state.

``` run-csharp
public class Chest
{
	static State Manipulate
		(State chest, Action action, bool haveKey) =>
		(chest, action, haveKey)
		{
			(ChestState.Locked, Action.Open, true) => ChestState.Open,
			(ChestState.Closed, Action.Open, _) => ChestState.Open,
			(ChestState.Open, Action.Close, true) => ChestState.Locked,
			(ChestState.Open, Action.Close, false) => ChestState.Closed,
			
			_ => chest
		};
}
```

``` run-csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
	var chest = ChestState.Locked;
	Console.WriteLine($"Chest is {chest}");

	chest = Manipulate(chest, Action.Open, true);
	Console.WriteLine($"Chest is {chest}");

	chest = Manipulate(chest, Action.Close, false);
	Console.WriteLine($"Chest is {chest}");

	chest = Manipulate(chest, Action.Close, false);
	Console.WriteLine($"Chest is {chest}");
}
```

``` run-csharp
Chest is Locked
Chest is Open
Chest is Closed
Chest is Closed
```
