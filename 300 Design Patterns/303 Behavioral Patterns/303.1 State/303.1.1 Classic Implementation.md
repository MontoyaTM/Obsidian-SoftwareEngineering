>  # Classic Implementation

This implementation is the classical way from State Design Pattern. It is a relic way of implementing this design pattern and is not recommended to use this.

``` run-csharp
public class Switch
{
	public State State = new OffState();
	public void On() { State.On(this); }
	public void Off() { State.Off(this); }
}
```

``` run-csharp
public abstract class State
{
	public virtual void On(Switch switch)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Light is already on.")
	}
	
	public virtual void Off(Switch switch)
	{
	Console.WriteLine("Light is already off.")
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public class OnState : State
{
	public OnState()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Light turned on.");
	}
	
	public override void Off(Switch switch)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Turning light off..."");
		switch.State = new OffState();
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public class OffState : State
{
	public OffState()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Light turned off.");
	}
	
	public override void On(Switch switch)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Turning light on..."");
		switch.State = new OnState();
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
static class Program
{
	public static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		var lightSwitch = new Switch();
		lightSwitch.On();
		lightSwitch.Off();
		lightSwitch.Off();
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
Light Turned Off.

Turning light on...
Light Turned on.
Turning light off...
Light turned off.
Light is already off.
```
