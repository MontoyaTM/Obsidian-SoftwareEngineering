This state machine will emulate a phone call where you can either be on call or on hold.

## State

Within any unique state, the program behaves differently, and the program can be switched from one state to another instantaneously. However, depending on a current state, the program may or may not switch to certain other states.

![[303.1.2 — State Enum.svg | 300]]

``` run-csharp
public enum State
{
	OffHook,
	Connecting, 
	Connected,
	OnHold
}
```

## Transitions

These switching rules, called _transitions_, are also finite and predetermined. To transition the context into another state, replace the active state object with another object that represents that new state.
![[303.1.2 — Trigger Enum.svg| 300]]

``` run-csharp
public enum Trigger
{
	CallDialed,
	HungUp,
	CallConnected,
	PlaceOnHold,
	TakenOffHold,
	LeftMessage
}
```

## Phone Class

The Handmade State Machine uses the Dictionary Data Structure to hold the values for the Transition and State properties.

![[303.1.2 — Dictionary.svg| 500]]

```run-csharp
class Phone
{
	private static Dictionary<State, List<(Trigger, State)>> rules = 
		new Dictionary<State, List<(Trigger, State)>>
		{
			[State.OffHook] = new List<(Trigger, State)>
			{
				(Trigger.CallDialed, State.Connecting)
			},
			
			[State.Connecting] = new List<(Trigger, State)>
			{
				(Trigger.HungUp, State.OffHook),
				(Trigger.CallConnected, State.Connected)
			},
			
			[State.Connected] = new List<(Trigger, State)>
			{
				(Trigger.LeftMessage, State.OffHook),
				(Trigger.HungUp, State.OffHook),
				(Trigger.PlacedOnHold, State.OnHold)
			},
			
			[State.OnHold] = new List<(Trigger, State)>
			{
				(Trigger.TakenOffHold, State.Connected),
				(Trigger.HungUp, State.OffHook)
			},
		};
}
```

``` run-csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
	var state = State.OffHook;
	
	while(true)
	{
		Console.WriteLine($"The phone is currently {state}");
		Console.WriteLine("Select a trigger:");
		
		for(int i = 0; i < rules[state].Count; i++)
		{
			var (t, _) = rules[state][i];
			Console.WriteLine($"{i}. {t}");
		}
		
		int input = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
		
		var (_, s) = rules[state][input];
		
		state = s;
}
```

``` run-csharp
The phone is currently OffHook
Select a trigger:
0. CallDialed

The phone is currently Connecting
Select a trigger:
0. HungUp
1. CallConnected

2. PlacedOnHold

The phone is currently OnHold

0

The phone is currently Connected
Select a trigger:
0. LeftMessage
