Switch-Based State Machine is a type of State Design Patterns where it is not required to define transition in some for of Dictionary or formalized structure.

## State

Within any unique state, the program behaves differently, and the program can be switched from one state to another instantaneously. However, depending on a current state, the program may or may not switch to certain other states.

![[303.1.3 â€” State Enum.svg| 300]]

``` run-csharp
public enum State
{
	Locked,
	Failed,
	Unlocked
}
```

## Lock Class

``` run-csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Enter the code:")
	
	string code = "1234";
	
	var state = State.Locked;
	var entry = new StringBuilder();
	
	while(true)
	{
		switch(state)
		{
			case State.Locked:
				entry.Append(Console.ReadKey().KeyChar);
				
				if(entry.ToString() == code)
				{
					state = State.Unlocked;
					break;
				}
				
				if(!code.StartsWith(entry.ToString()))
				{
					state = Stae.Failed;
				}
				break;
				
			case State.Failed:
				Console.CursorLeft = 0;
				Console.WriteLine("FAILED");
				entry.Clear();
				state = State.Locked;
				
				break;
				
			case State.Unlocked:
				Console.CursorLeft = 0;
				Console.WriteLine("UNLOCKED");
				
				return;
		}
	}
}
```
