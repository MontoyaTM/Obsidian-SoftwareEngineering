<span style="color:#81fd83">Adapter</span> is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

Imagine that you’re creating a stock market monitoring app. The app downloads the stock data from multiple sources in XML format and then displays nice-looking charts and diagrams for the user.

At some point, you decide to improve the app by integrating a smart 3rd-party analytics library. But there’s a catch: the analytics library only works with data in JSON format.

You could change the library to work with XML. However, this might break some existing code that relies on the library. And worse, you might not have access to the library’s source code in the first place, making this approach impossible.

You can create an _adapter_. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.

- An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. The wrapped object isn’t even aware of the adapter.

Adapters can not only convert data into various formats but can also help objects with different interfaces collaborate:

1. The adapter gets an interface, compatible with one of the existing objects.
2. Using this interface, the existing object can safely call the adapter’s methods.
3. Upon receiving a call, the adapter passes the request to the second object, but in a format and order that the second object expects.

The Adapter pattern lets you create a middle-layer class that serves as a translator between your code and a legacy class, a 3rd-party class or any other class with a weird interface.

You could extend each subclass and put the missing functionality into new child classes. However, you’ll need to duplicate the code across all of these new classes, which smells really bad.

The much more elegant solution would be to put the missing functionality into an adapter class. Then you would wrap objects with missing features inside the adapter, gaining needed features dynamically.

> # Pros and Cons 

### Pros:
- _Single Responsibility Principle_. You can separate the interface or data conversion code from the primary business logic of the program.
- _Open/Closed Principle_. You can introduce new types of adapters into the program without breaking the existing client code, as long as they work with the adapters through the client interface.

### Cons:

- The overall complexity of the code increases because you need to introduce a set of new interfaces and classes. Sometimes it’s simpler just to change the service class so that it matches the rest of your code.
