>  # Design Patterns

<font style="color:#b562f9">Design patterns</font> are typical <font style="color:#81fd83">solutions</font> to commonly <font style="color:#81fd83">occurring problems</font> in software design. They are like <font style="color:#fd9bd4">pre-made blueprints</font> that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code. 

They represent best practices and proven solutions to specific design challenges, allowing developers to leverage established solutions instead of reinventing the wheel.

<font style="color:#b562f9">Patterns</font> are often confused with <font style="color:#47fff3">algorithms</font>, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a <font style="color:#47fff3">clear set of actions</font> that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more <font style="color:#b562f9">high-level description</font> of a solution.

## What does the pattern consist of?

Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

-   <font style="color:#b562f9">Intent</font> of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
-   <font style="color:#b562f9">Motivation</font> further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
-   <font style="color:#b562f9">Structure</font> of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
-   <font style="color:#b562f9">Code example</font> in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.
