>  # Merge Sorted Arrays

In C#, merging <font style="color:#81fd83">sorted arrays</font> involves combining two or more sorted arrays into a single sorted array. The resulting array contains all the elements from the input arrays, arranged in ascending order.

> [!important] 
> In C#, arrays are immutable after creation. This means that you would need to create a separate array to allocate the space needed and then duplicate its content.

``` run-csharp
public int[] MergeSortedArray(int[] array1, int[] array2)
{
	// These values keep track of their position in their respective array index.
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;

    int totalLength = array1.Length + array2.Length;
    int[] temp = new int[totalLength];

    // Iterrate though equal length arrays and insert the smaller of the two 
    // values into the empty temp[] array.
    while(i < array1.Length &&  j < array2.Length)
    {
        if (array1[i] >= array2[j])
        {
            // Array2[j] is smaller
            temp[k++] = array2[j++];
        } else {
	        // Array1[i] is smaller
            temp[k++] = array1[i++];
        }
    }

// These while loops are used when one of the array contains more values than the
// other. The remaining values will be added in the end of the temp[] array as it
// it already sorted.

    while(i <  array1.Length)
    {
        temp[k++] = array1[i++];
    }

    while(j < array2.Length)
    {
        temp[k++]= array2[j++];
    }

    return temp;
}
