In C#, a <font style="color:#b562f9">HashTable</font> is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve key-value pairs. 

It provides a <font style="color:#81fd83">fast</font> way to <font style="color:#81fd83">access</font> values based on their corresponding <font style="color:#b562f9">keys</font>. When you store a value in a HashtTable, you associate it with a unique key. Later, you can retrieve the value by providing the key, and the HashtTable will quickly locate the corresponding value.
