A binary tree is a tree data structure where each <span style="color:#81fd83">node</span> has at most <span style="color:#81fd83">two children</span>. The topmost node in the tree is called the root, and **nodes with no children are called a leafs**. Each node has a value or data, which can be of any type.

In a binary **search** tree, **the left child of a node has a smaller value than the node, and the right child has a larger value**. This property is called the **binary search tree property**, and it allows us to perform various operations efficiently.

> ## Node 

A Node is a fundamental building block that is used to implement various data structures such as the Binary Tree. 
- <span style="color:#81fd83">data</span> — This component contains the actual data type information associated with the node.
- <span style="color:#81fd83">left</span> — This component contains a reference to the left child Node in the Binary Tree. 
- <span style="color:#81fd83">right</span> — This component contains a reference to the right child Node of the Binary Tree.

``` run-csharp
public class Node
{
	public Node left;
	public Node right;
	public int data;

	public Node(int data)
	{
		this.left = null;
		this.right = null;
		this.data = data;
	}
}
```

> ## Binary Search Tree 

A binary search tree that contains a max of 2 child nodes per node. A property of a binary search tree is that the left node is smaller (or equal) and the right node being strictly larger.

![[Binary Search Tree.svg| 600]]


``` run-csharp 
public class BinarySearchTree
{
	public Node root;
	
	public BinarySearchTree()
	{
		this.root = null;
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
	BinarySearchTree tree = new BinarySearchTree();
}
```

## Insert

<span style="color:#81fd83">Insert()</span> is a method that receives an integer parameter for initializing a new Node. This Node will then be inserted into the Binary Search Tree depending on it's value compared to the left or right nodes.


![[Binary Search Tree — Insert.1.svg| 500]]


``` run-csharp
public bool Insert(int value)
{
	Node node = new Node(value);
	
	if(this.root == null)
	{
		this.root = node;
		return true;
	}
	
	Node curr = this.root;
	
	while(curr != null)
	{
		if(value < curr.data)
		{
			if(curr.left == null)
			{
				curr.left = node;
				return true;
			} 
			curr = curr.left;
		} 
		else if(value > curr.data)
		{
			if(curr.right == null)
			{
				curr.right = node;
				return true;
			} 
			curr = curr.right;
		}
		else
		{
			Console.Writeline("Node already exists!")
			break;
		}
	}

	return false;
}
```

``` run-csharp
 static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		BinarySearchTree tree = new BinarySearchTree();
		tree.Insert(68);
		tree.Insert(84);
		tree.Insert(91);
		tree.Insert(71);
		tree.Insert(78);
		tree.Insert(69);
		tree.Insert(80);
		tree.Insert(29);
		tree.Insert(14);
		tree.Insert(50);
		tree.Insert(42);
		tree.Insert(44);
		tree.Insert(24);
		tree.Insert(16);
		tree.Insert(11);
		tree.Insert(6);
}
```

## Lookup()

<span style="color:#81fd83">Lookup()</span> is a method that receives an integer value to be found within the Binary Search Tree. It will traverse the Binary Search Tree on 3 conditions:

- value is <span style="color:#81fd83">less than</span> the data of the current node
- value is <span style="color:#81fd83">greater than</span> the data of the current node
- value is <span style="color:#81fd83">equal to</span> the data of the current node


![[Binary Search Tree.2.svg]]


``` run-csharp
public bool Lookup(int value)
{
	if(this.root == null) return false;
	
	Node curr = this.root;
	
	while(curr != null)
	{
		if(value < curr.data)
		{
			curr = curr.left;
		} 
		else if(value > curr.data)
		{
			curr = curr.right;
		}
		else
		{
			return true;
		}
	}
	
	return false;
}
```


![[Binary Search Tree — Lookup.svg]]


``` run-csharp
 static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		BinarySearchTree tree = new BinarySearchTree();
		tree.Insert(68);
		tree.Insert(84);
		tree.Insert(91);
		tree.Insert(71);
		tree.Insert(78);
		tree.Insert(69);
		tree.Insert(80);
		tree.Insert(29);
		tree.Insert(14);
		tree.Insert(50);
		tree.Insert(42);
		tree.Insert(44);
		tree.Insert(24);
		tree.Insert(16);
		tree.Insert(11);
		tree.Insert(6);
		
		tree.Lookup(78)
}
```

## Remove

<span style="color:#81fd83">Remove()</span> is a method that receives an integer value to be found within the Binary Search Tree so that it can be removed. The difficult part of this method come from retaining the rules of a Binary Search Tree where the left node must be smaller and the right node must be bigger.

Traverse the Binary Search Tree to determine if the value exist within the tree; if it exists (<span style="color:#81fd83">Current Node</span>), there are 2 cases for removing a node.

If the Current Node is equal to null; return false as it was not found within the Binary Search Tree

There are 2 cases when it comes to removing a Node:
- Case 1: Current Node has a <span style="color:#81fd83">right child</span> (<span style="color:#e493fb">Traverse to find leftmost</span>)
	- Set the <span style="color:#81fd83">Replacement</span> Node to Current Node's right child
		- If Replacement Node's left child does not exist then set the Replacement Node's left to <span style="color:#81fd83">Current Node's left child</span>
	- Create a new node, <span style="color:#81fd83">ReplacementParent Node</span>
	- Traverse until you find leftmost node
		- While traversing, set ReplacementParent Node to Replacement Node and Replacement to it's left until you hit a null
		- Set ReplacementParent left child node equal to null (this node is Replacement Node)
		- Set Replacement Node left equal to the Current Node's left and Replacement Node's right to the Current Node's right

- Case 2: Current Node has <span style="color:#81fd83">only a left child</span>
	- Set the Replacement Node equal to the Current Node's left child

Once the Replacement Node has been determined; link the Parent Node to it
- Case 1: Parent Node is <span style="color:#81fd83">equal to null</span>
	- Set the root equal to the Replacement Node

- Case 2: Parent Node's left child is equal to Current Node (Node to be removed)
	- Link the Parent Node's left child equal to the Replacement Node

- Case 3: Parent Node's right child is equal to the Current Node (Node to be removed)
	- Link the Parent Node's right child equal to the Replacement Node

![[Binary Search Tree.2.svg]]

``` run-csharp
public bool Remove(int value)
{
	if(this.root = null) return false;
	
	Node curr = this.root;
	Node parent = null;
	
	// Locate the value within the BST
	while(curr != null)
	{
		if(value < curr.data)
		{
			parent = curr;
			curr = curr.left;
		}
		else if(vale > curr.data)
		{
			parent = curr;
			curr = curr.left;
		}
		else
		{
			break;
		}
	}
	
	// Value is not found
	if(curr == null) return false;
	
	Node replacement = null;
	
	// Curr node has a right node
	if(curr.right != null)
	{
		// Traverse right subtree to get leftmost node
		replacement = curr.right;
		
		// Leftmost does not exist
		if(replacement.left == null)
		{
			replacement.left == curr.left;
		} 
		else // Leftmost exists
		{
			Node replacementParent = curr;
			while(replacement.left != null)
			{
				replacementParent = replacement;
				replacement = replacement.left;
			}
			
			replacementParent.left = null;
			replacement.left = curr.left;
			replacement.right = curr.right;
		}
	}
	else if(curr.left != null) // Curr node has only a left node
	{
		replacement = curr.left;
	}
	
	if(parent == null)
	{
		this.root = replacement;
	}
	else if(parent.left == curr)
	{
		parent.left = replacement;
	}
	else if(parent.right == curr)
	{
		parent.right = replacement;
	}
	
	return true;
}
```
