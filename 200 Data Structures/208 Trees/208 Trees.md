A tree data structure is a <span style="color:#81fd83">hierarchical</span> structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. It is a collection of <span style="color:#81fd83">nodes</span> that are connected by <span style="color:#81fd83">edges</span> and has a hierarchical relationship between the nodes. 

The <span style="color:#81fd83">topmost</span> node of the tree is called the <span style="color:#81fd83">root</span>, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.
