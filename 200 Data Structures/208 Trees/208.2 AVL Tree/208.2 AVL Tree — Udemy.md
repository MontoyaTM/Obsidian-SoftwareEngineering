An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This balancing property helps maintain the tree's efficiency by ensuring that the height of the tree remains logarithmic, which in turn keeps operations like insertion, deletion, and search within a logarithmic time complexity.

A Node is a fundamental building block that is used to implement various data structures such as the Binary Tree. 
- <span style="color:#81fd83">data</span> — This component contains the actual data type information associated with the node.
- <span style="color:#81fd83">height</span> — This component contains the height associated with the node.
- <span style="color:#81fd83">left</span> — This component contains a reference to the left child Node in the Binary Tree. 
- <span style="color:#81fd83">right</span> — This component contains a reference to the right child Node of the Binary Tree.

``` run-csharp
public class Node
{
	public Node left;
	public Node right;
	public int data;
	public int height;

	public Node(int data)
	{
		this.left = null;
		this.right = null;
		this.data = data;
		this.height = 1;
	}
}
```

> ## AVL Tree 


AVL tree is a <span style="color:#81fd83">self-balancing</span> Binary Search Tree (**BST**) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than **one** for all nodes.

Most of the BST operations (e.g., search, max, min, insert, delete.. etc) take <span style="color:#81fd83">O(h)</span> time where **h** is the height of the BST. The cost of these operations may become **O(n)** for a **skewed Binary tree**. If we make sure that the height of the tree remains **O(log(n))** after every insertion and deletion, then we can guarantee an upper bound of <span style="color:#81fd83">O(log(n))</span> for all these operations. The height of an AVL tree is always **O(log(n))** where **n** is the number of nodes in the tree.

	public AVLTree()

``` run-csharp

	AVLTree tree = new AVLTree();
