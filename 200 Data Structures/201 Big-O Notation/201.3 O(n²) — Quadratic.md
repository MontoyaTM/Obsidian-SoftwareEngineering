In Big-O notation, <font style="color:#b562f9">O(n²)</font> represents <font style="color:#81fd83">quadratic time complexity</font>. It signifies that the time or space required by an algorithm grows quadratically in proportion to the square of the input size.

``` run-csharp
void QuadraticAlgorithm(int[] array) 
{ 
	for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++) 
	{ 
		for (int j = 0; j < array.Length; j++) 
		{  
			Console.WriteLine(array[i] + array[j]); 
		} 
	} 
}
```

It's important to note that algorithms with quadratic time complexity can become <font style="color:#b562f9">inefficient</font> for larger input sizes. As the input grows, the number of operations increases significantly, potentially leading to long execution times. 

- It is often desirable to <font style="color:#81fd83">optimize</font> such algorithms to improve their efficiency or explore alternative  algorithms with better time complexity.
