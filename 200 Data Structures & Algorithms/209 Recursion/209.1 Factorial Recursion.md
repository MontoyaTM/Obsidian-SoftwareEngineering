***Write a program in C# Sharp to create a recursive function to find the factorial of a given number.***

Factorial recursion is a common problem in computer science and mathematics. It involves writing a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer.


``` run-csharp
public static int Factorial(int n)
{ 
	// Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1 
	if (n == 0 || n == 1) 
	{ 
		return 1; 
	} 
	
	return n * Factorial(n - 1);  
}
```
