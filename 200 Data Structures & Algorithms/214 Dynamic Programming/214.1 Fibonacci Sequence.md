The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (called a Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence typically starts with 0 and 1. The sequence goes as follows:

F(0)=0,F(1)=1 
𝐹(𝑛)=𝐹(𝑛−1)+𝐹(𝑛−2) for 𝑛≥2F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)forn≥2

## Memoization

Memoization involves caching expensive function calls to avoid redundant computations. This optimization is particularly useful for recursive algorithms, as it prevents recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

### How to Implement Memoization in C#:

1. Define a data structure, such as a dictionary, to store computed results.
2. Create a recursive function to solve the problem efficiently.
3. At the beginning of the recursive function, check if the result for the current input exists in the dictionary. If so, return the cached result.
4. If the result is not found, calculate it, store it in the dictionary, and return it.


``` run-csharp
public class FibonacciMeoize
{
	private Dictionary<int, int> memoize = new Dictionary<int, int>();
	
	public int fibonacci(int num)
	{
		if(num < 0) throw new ArgumentException("Input must no be a non-negative number");
		
		if(n == 0 || n == 1)
		{
			return n;
		}
		
		if(memoize.ContainsKey(numm))
		{
			return memoize[n];
		}
		
		int fibValue = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
		memoize[n] = fibValue;
		
		return fibValue;
	}
}
```
