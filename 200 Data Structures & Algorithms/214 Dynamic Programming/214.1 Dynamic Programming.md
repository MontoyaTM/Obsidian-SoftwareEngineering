Dynamic programming is a method used in computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is particularly useful for optimization problems. Dynamic Programming solves each subproblem only once and stores its solution in a table (usually an array or a matrix), thereby avoiding the need to recompute the solution every time the subproblem is encountered again.

- **<span style="color:#81fd83">Efficiency</span>**: Reduces the time complexity by storing the results of subproblems, preventing redundant calculations.

- **<span style="color:#81fd83">Optimal Substructure</span>**: Ensures that the optimal solution of the main problem can be constructed efficiently from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

- **<span style="color:#81fd83">Overlapping Subproblems</span>**: Efficiently solves problems with overlapping subproblems by storing their results and reusing them.

## Memoization

Memoization involves caching expensive function calls to avoid redundant computations. This optimization is particularly useful for recursive algorithms, as it prevents recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.
