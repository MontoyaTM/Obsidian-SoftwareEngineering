In Big-O notation, <font style="color:#b562f9">O(n)</font> represents <font style="color:#81fd83">linear time complexity</font>. It signifies that the time or space required by an algorithm grows linearly in proportion to the input size.

``` run-csharp
void LinearAlgorithm(int[] array) 
{ 
	for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++) 
	{ 
		// Perform a constant-time operation on each element Console.WriteLine(array[i]); 
	} 
}
```

O(n) is typically represented with loops: for, while and is proportionally determined based on the input size.
