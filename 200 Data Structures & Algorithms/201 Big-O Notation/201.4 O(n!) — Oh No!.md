An algorithm with <font style="color:#b562f9">O(n!)</font> time complexity means that the number of operations or the amount of space used by the algorithm <font style="color:#81fd83">increases</font> rapidly as the input size grows. Specifically, it grows by a factor of n <font style="color:#81fd83">factorial</font>, where n is the size of the input.
