>  # Minimum Window Sort

Given an array, find the length of the smallest subarray in it which when sorted will sort the whole array.

> ## Solution 

As we know, once an array is sorted (in ascending order), the smallest number is at the beginning and the largest number is at the end of the array.

In the following array, what are the first numbers out of sorting order from the beginning and the end of the array:

``` run-csharp
[1, 3, 2, 0, -1, 7, 10]
```

   - Starting from the beginning of the array the first number out of the sorting order is ‘2’.
   - Starting from the end of the array the first number out of the sorting order is ‘0’

As you can see, sorting the numbers between ‘3’ and ‘-1’ will not sort the whole array.

``` run-csharp
[1,  | -1, 0, 2, 3, |  7, 10]
```

The problem here is that the smallest number of our subarray is ‘-1’ which dictates that we need to include more numbers from the beginning of the array to make the whole array sorted.  We will have a similar problem if the maximum of the subarray is bigger than some elements at the end of the array.

   - To sort the whole array we need to include all such elements that are smaller than the biggest element of the subarray.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm


##### 1. Initialize Pointers:

   - Set `low` to 0 and `high` to the last index in the array

##### 2. Find Left Boundary:

   - Move `low` to the right while the current element is less than or equal to the next element.

##### 3. Check if Sorted:

   - If `low` reaches the end, the array is already sorted. Return 0.

##### 4. **Find Right Boundary**:

   - Move `high` to the left while the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element.

##### 5. Find Min and Max

   - Iterate from `low` to `high` to find the minimum and maximum values in this subarray

##### 6. Extend Left Boundary:
   
   - Move `low` to the left while the previous element is greater than the subarray's minimum.

##### 7. Extend Right Boundary:

   - Move `high` to the right while the next element is less than the subarray's maximum.

##### 8. **Calculate Length**:

   - The length of the subarray to be sorted is `high - low + 1`.

``` run-csharp
public int minimumWindowSort(int[] nums)
{
	int low = 0, high = nums.Length - 1;
	
	while(low < nums.Length - 1 && nums[low] <= nums[low + 1])
		low++;
		
	if(low == nums/Length - 1)
		return 0;
		
	while(high > 0 && nums[high] >= nums[high - 1])
		high--;
		
	int max = int.MinValue, max = int.MinValue;
	
	for(int i = low; i <= high; i++)
	{
		max = Math.Max(max, nums[i]);
		min = Math.Min(min, nums[i]);
	}
	
	while(low > 0 && nums[low - 1] > min)
		low--;
	
	while(high < nums.Length - 1 && nums[high + 1] < max)
		high++;
	
	return high - low + 1;
}
```
