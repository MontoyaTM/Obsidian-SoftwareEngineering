Given a sorted array, create a new array containing squares of all the numbers of the input array in the sorted order.

> ## Solution 

Utilize the **Two Pointers** technique to iterate over the array, since the numbers at both ends can give us the largest square, an alternate approach could be to use two pointers starting at both ends of the input array.

   - At any step, whichever pointer gives us the bigger square, we add it to the result array and move to the next/previous number.

> [!caution] 
> Please note that we will be appending the bigger square because the two pointers are moving from larger squares to smaller squares.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm

##### 1. Initialize Variables

   - We start by obtaining the length of the input array, `nums`, which we store in variable `k`.
   - Create a new array, `squared`, of the same length to hold the squared values.
   - Create a variable `highestSquareIdx` and set it to `n - 1`, the last index of `squares`, which will help us populate the `squares` array from the highest (rightmost) index towards the lowest (leftmost).
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively.
	   - These pointers represent the indices of the elements at the start (lowest) and end (highest) of the array.

``` run-csharp
	int[] squared = new int[nums.Length];
	int i = 0, j = nums.Length - 1; k = nums.Length;
```

##### 2. **Iterate through the Array:**

   - We enter a loop that continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
   - In each iteration, we calculate the squares of the elements at the `left` and `right` indices, storing them in `iPow` and `jPow` respectively.

``` run-csharp
	While(left < right)
	{
		int iPow = nums[i] * nums[i]; 
		int jPow = nums[j] * nums[j];
	}
```

##### 3. Compare the values:

   - The larger of these two squares is inserted at the position of `highestSquareIdx` in the `squares` array, and `highestSquareIdx` is decremented.
   - If `leftSquare` was larger, we increment `left` to move towards the higher numbers in the array.
   - If `rightSquare` was larger or equal, we decrement `right` to move towards the lower numbers in the array.

``` run-csharp
		if(iPow > jPow)
		{
			squared[k--] = iPow;
			i++;
		} 
		else
		{
			squared[k--] = jPow;
			j--;
		}
```

##### 4. Return result:

   - We're comparing absolute square values, so even if numbers in the array are negative, we're dealing with their positive square.
   - This process repeats, filling up the `squares` array from right to left, until `left` and `right` meet or cross each other.


> [!example] 
>  ## Code Snippet

``` run-csharp
public int[] SquaringNums(int[] nums)
{
	int[] squared = new int[nums.Length];
	
	int i = 0, j = nums.Length - 1, k = squared.Length - 1;
	
	while(i <= j)
	{
		int iPow = nums[i] * nums[i];
		int jPow = nums[j] * nums[j];
		
		if(iPow > jPow)
		{
			squared[k--] = iPow;
			i++;
		} 
		else
		{
			squared[k--] = jPow;
			j--;
		}
	}

	return squared;
}

```
