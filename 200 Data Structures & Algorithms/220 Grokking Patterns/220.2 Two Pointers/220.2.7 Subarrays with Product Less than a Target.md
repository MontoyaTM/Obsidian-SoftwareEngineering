>  # Subarrays with Product Less than a Target

Given an array with positive numbers and a positive target number, find all of its contiguous subarrays whose `product is less than the target number`.

This problem follows the <span style="color:#81fd83">Sliding Window</span> and the <span style="color:#81fd83">Two Pointers</span> pattern and shares similarities with Triplets with Smaller Sum with two differences:

   - Input array is not sorted
   - Find all subarrays having a product less than the target

## Step-by-Step Algorithm

##### 1. Sliding Window Approach:

   - The algorithm uses a sliding window approach combined with a two-pointer method. A `window` of subarray is defined between the indices pointed to by two pointers, `left` and `right`.
   
   - The window starts from the leftmost side of the array.
	   - The `left` and `right` variables are initialized at position 0.
	   - It slides to the right one element at a time, expanding the window.

``` run-csharp
	int left = 0;
	for(int right = 0; i < nums.Length; right++;)
```

##### 2. Calculating the Product:

   - As we add a new element into the window `right`, we multiple the current `product` with this new element.

``` run-csharp
		product *= nums[right];
```

##### 3. Product Larger than Target:

   - If at any point the `product` of the numbers within the window become greater or equal to the target, we need to make the product smaller.
	   - This is achieved by moving the `left++` pointer towards the end of the array. We are essentially dividing the `product` by removing this element. Continue until product is less than the target,

``` run-csharp
		while(product >= target && left < nums.Length)
		{
			product /= nums[left--];
		}
```

##### 4. Possible Subarrays until Right:

   - For each position of `right`, we create all possible subarrays that end at `right`, and that have a product less than the `target`.
	   - We do this by starting with a subarray that only includes the `right` element, then progressively adding the element to its left, and so on, until we reach the `left` pointer.

``` run-csharp
		List<int> temp = new List<int>();
		
		for(int i = right; i >= left; i--)
		{
			temp.Inser(0, nums[i]);
			results.Add(new List<int>(temp));
		}
```

> [!example] 
>  ## Code Snippet

``` run-csharp
public List<List<int>> findSubarrays(int[] nums, int target)
{
	List<List<int>> result =  new List<List<int>>();
	
	double product = 1;
	int left = 0;
	
	for(int right = 0; right < nums.Length; right++)
	{
		product *= nums[right];
		
		while(product >= target && left < nums.Length)
		{
			product /= nums[left++];
		}
		
		List<int> temp = new List<int>();
		
		for(int i = right;  i >= left; i--)
		{
			temp.Insert(0, nums[i]);
			result.Add(new List<int>(temp));
		}
	}
	
	return result;
}
```
