>  # Triplet Sum Close to Target

Given an array of unsorted numbers and a target number, find a triplet in the array whose sum is as close to the target number as possible, return the sum of the triplet

- If there are more than one such triplet, return the sum of the triplet with the smallest sum.

> ## Solution 

This problem follows the **Two Pointers** pattern and is quite similar to `Triplet Sum to Zero`. We can follow a similar approach to iterate through the array, taking one number at a time.

   - At every step, we will save the difference between the triplet and the target number, so that in the end, we can return the triplet with the closest sum.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm

##### 1. Error Handling:

   - The method checks whether the input array `nums` is `null` or its length is less than 3.
      - throw `IllegalArgumentException`

``` run-csharp
	if (nums == null || nums.Length < 3)

            throw new ArgumentException();
```

##### 2. Sorting:

   - Sorting is important as it allows us to move our pointers based on the sum we are getting and how close we are to the target sum.

``` run-csharp
	Array.Sort(nums);
```

##### 3. Smallest Difference:

   - The `smallestDistance` variable will keep track of the smallest difference between target sum and the sum of the current triplet.
	   - Initialized to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`

##### 4. Loop through Array:

   - Create a method to iterate through the array using a `for` loop, stopping when it is two positions from the end of the array. (A triplet must be formed)

``` run-csharp
	for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length - 2; i++)
```

   - Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to keep track of both ends

``` run-csharp
	int left = i + 1, right = nums.Length - 1;
```

##### 5. Initialize a While loop:

   - Initialize a while loops that continues so long that `left is less than right`. 
   - Calculate the difference between the target sum and the sum of the numbers at the current position, `targetDiff`. 
	   - This will allow us to determine the closest triplet to the target sum.

``` run-csharp
	while(left < right)
	{
		int targetDiff =  targetSum - nums[i] - nums[left] - nums[right];
	}
```

##### 6. Conditionals:

   - If `targetDiff` is equal to zero, then the triplets exactly matches the target sum and return the `targetSum` immediately. 
   - Check if the absolute value of `targetDiff` is less than the `smallestDifference` (meaning we've found a closer sum) or equal but `targetDiff` is greater (meaning it's a larger sum that is equally close).
	   - If either is true, we update `smallestDifference` to  `targetDiff`.
   - If `targetDiff` is greater than zero we increment left to increase the current triplet sum and decrement right to decrease.

``` run-csharp
	if(targetDiff == 0) return targetSum;
	
	if(Math.Abs(targetDiff) < Math.Abs(smallestDifference) 
	|| (Math.Abs(targetDiff) == Math.Abs(smallestDifference)) 
	&& targetDiff > smallestDifference))
		smallestDifference = targetDiff;
		
	if(targetDiff > 0)
		left++
	else
		right--;
		
```

##### 7. Return

   - Once all possible triplets have been considered, the function returns `targetSum - smallestDifference`. This is the sum of the triplet that was closest to our target sum.

``` run-csharp
	return targetSum - smallestDifference;
```


> [!example] 
>  ## Code Snippet

``` run-csharp
	public int SearchhTriplet(int nums[], int targetSum)
	{
		if(nums == null || nums.Length < 3)
			throw new ArguementException();
		
		Array.Sort(nums);
		int smallestDifference = int.MaxValue;
		
		for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length - 2; i++)
		{
			int left = i + 1, right = nums.Length - 1;
			
			while(left < right)
			{
				int targetDiff = targetSum - nums[i] - nums[left] - nums[right];
				
				if(targetDiff == 0)
					return targetSum;
				
				if(Math.Abs(targetDiff) < Math.Abs(smallestDifference))
					|| (Math.Abs(targetDiff) == Math.Abs(smallestDifference))
					&& targetDiff > smallestDifference))
				{
					smallestDifference = targetDiff;
				}
				
				if(targetDiff > 0)
					left++;
				else
					right--;
			}
		}
		return targetSum - smallestDifference;
	}
```
