Any number will be called a happy number if, after repeatedly replacing it with a number equal to the **sum of the square of all of its digits, leads us to the number `1`. All other (not-happy) numbers will never reach `1`**. Instead, they will be stuck in a cycle of numbers that does not include `1`.

Given a positive number `n`, return `true` if it is a happy number otherwise return `false`.
