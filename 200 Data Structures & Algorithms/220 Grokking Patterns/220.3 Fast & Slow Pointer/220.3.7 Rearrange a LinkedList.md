>  # Rearrange a LinkedList

Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to modify the LinkedList such that the **nodes from the second half of the LinkedList are inserted alternately to the nodes from the first half in reverse order**. So if the LinkedList has nodes `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> null`, your method should return `1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> null`.

Your algorithm should use only constant space the input LinkedList should be modified in-place.

> ## Solution 

This problem shares similarities with the `Palindrome LinkedList`. To rearrange the given LinkedList you must first divide the LinkedList into two halves and reverse the second half so that it can be rearranged in order.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm

##### 1. Fast & Slow Pointer
   
   - We can use the **Fast & Slow pointers** method similar to `Middle of the LinkedList` to find the middle node of the LinkedList.

##### 2. Reverse Second Half of LinkedList
   
   - Once we have the middle of the LinkedList, we will reverse the second half of the LinkedList.

##### 3. Merge Halves Together
   
   - Finally, we’ll iterate through the first half and the reversed second half to produce a LinkedList in the required order

``` run-csharp
public class Node
{
	public int data = 0;
	public Node next;
	
	public Node(int data)
	{
		this.data = data;
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public Node Reorder(Node head)
{
	Node slow = head;
	Node fast = head;
	
	while(fast != null & fast.next  != null)
	{
		slow = slow.next;
		fast = fast.next.next;
	}
	
	Node reversed = Reverse(slow);
	head = Organize(head, node); 
	
	return head;
}
```

``` run-csharp
public Node Reverse(Node node)
{
	Node prev = null;
	
	while(node != null)
	{
		Node next = node.next;
		node.next = prev;
		prev = node;
		node = next; 
	}
	
	return node;
}
```

``` run-csharp
public Node Organize(Node head, Node reversed)
{	
	Node start = head;
	
	while(head != null && reversed != null)
	{
		next = head.next;
		head.next = reversed;
		head = next;
		next = revered.next;
		reversed.next = head;
		reversed = next;
	}
	
	if(head != null)
	{
		head.next = null;
	}
	
	return start;
}
```
