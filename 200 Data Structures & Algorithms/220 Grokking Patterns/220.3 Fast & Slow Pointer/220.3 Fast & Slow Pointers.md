The <span style="color:#81fd83">Fast & Slow</span> pointer approach, also known as the `Hare & Tortoise algorithm`, is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different speeds.

   - This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic LinkedLists or arrays.

> ## Solution 

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.
