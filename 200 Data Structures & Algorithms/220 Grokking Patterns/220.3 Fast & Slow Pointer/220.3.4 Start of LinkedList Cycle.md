>  # Start of LinkedList Cycle

Given the head of a **Singly LinkedList** that contains a cycle, write a function to find the **starting node of the cycle**.

> [!success] 
> ## Solution 

If we know the length of the **LinkedList** cycle, we can find the start of the cycle through the following steps:
## Step-by-Step Algorithm

##### 1. Initialize Variables:

   - Take two pointers. Let’s call them `pointer1` and `pointer2`. Initialize both pointers to the start of the LinkedList.

##### 2. Find Length of Cycle:

   - We can find the length of the LinkedList cycle using the approach discussed in LinkedList Cycle. Let’s assume that the length of the cycle is ‘K’ nodes.

##### 3. Second Pointer:

   - Move `pointer2` ahead by ‘K’ nodes using the length of the cycle and decrement after each pass.

##### 4. Unite both Pointers:

   - Now, keep incrementing `pointer1` and `pointer2` until they both meet. 
   - As `pointer2` is ‘K’ nodes ahead of `pointer1`, which means, `pointer2` must have completed one loop in the cycle when both pointers meet. Their meeting point will be the start of the cycle.

``` run-csharp
public class Node
{
	public int data = 0;
	public Node next;
	
	public Node(int data)
	{
		this.data = data;
		this.next = null;
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public Node findCycleStart(Node head)
{
	Node slow = head;
	Node fast = head;
	int length = 0;
	
	while(fast != mull && fast.next != null)
	{
		fast = fast.next.next;
		slow = slow.next;
		
		if(slow == fast)
		{
			length = findCycleLength(slow);
			break; 
		}
	}
	
	return findStart(head, length);
}
```

``` run-csharp
public int findCycleLength(Node slow)
{
	Node current = slow;
	int length = 0;
	
	do
	{
		current = current.next;
		length++;
	}while(current != slow)
	
	return length;
}
```

``` run-csharp
public Node findStart(Node head, int length)
{
	Node pointer1 = head;
	Node pointer2 = head;
	
	while(length > 0)
	{
		pointer1 = pointer1.next;
		length--;
	}
	
	while(pointer2 != pointer1)
	{
		pointer1 = pointer1.next;
		pointer2 = pointer2.next;
	}
	
	return pointer2;
}
```
