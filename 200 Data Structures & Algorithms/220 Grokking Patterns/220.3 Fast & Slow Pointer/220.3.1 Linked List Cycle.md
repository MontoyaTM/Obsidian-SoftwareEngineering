Given the head of a **Singly LinkedList**, write a function to determine if the LinkedList has a **cycle** in it or not.

Imagine two racers running in a circular racing track. If one racer is faster than the other, the faster racer is bound to catch up and cross the slower racer from behind.

We can use this fact to devise an algorithm to determine if a LinkedList has a cycle in it or not.

This gives us two conclusions:

   - If the LinkedList doesn’t have a cycle in it, the fast pointer will reach the end of the LinkedList before the slow pointer to reveal that there is no cycle in the LinkedList

   - The slow pointer will never be able to catch up to the fast pointer if there is no cycle in the LinkedList

``` run-csharp
public bool hasCycle(Node head)
{
	Node slow = head;
	Node fast = head;
	
	while(fast != null && fast.next != null)
	{
		fast = fast.next.next;
		slow = slow.next;
		
		if(slow == fast)
		{
			return true;
		}
	}
	
	return false;
}
```
