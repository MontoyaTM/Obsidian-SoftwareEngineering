>  # Cycle in a Circular Array

We are given an array containing positive and negative numbers. Suppose the array contains a number ‘M’ at a particular index. Now, if ‘M’ is positive we will move forward ‘M’ indices and if ‘M’ is negative move backwards ‘M’ indices. You should assume that the **array is circular which means two things:

 - If, while moving forward, we reach the end of the array, we will jump to the first element to continue the movement.

 - If, while moving backward, we reach the beginning of the array, we will jump to the last element to continue the movement.

Write a method to determine **if the array has a cycle**. The cycle should have more than one element and should follow one direction which means the cycle should not contain both forward and backward movements.

> ## Solution: 

We know that all such numbers will not produce a cycle for any other instance as well. If we can remember all the numbers that have been visited, our algorithm will improve to O(N) as, then, each number will be evaluated for cycles only once. We can keep track of this by creating a separate array.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm

##### 1. Initialize Visited Array:

   - Create a boolean array `visited` to keep track of visited indices, initially set to `false`

##### 2. Iterate Through each Index:

   - Loop through each index `i` in the array `arr`
   - If `i` is already visited, skip to the next index
   - Determine the direction of movement (`isForward`) based on the sign of `arr[i]`

##### 3. Initialize Slow and Fast Pointers:

   - Set both `slow` and `fast` pointers to the current index `i`

##### 4. **Cycle Detection Using Slow and Fast Pointers**:

   - Enter a loop to move the `slow` and `fast` pointers

	   - Move `slow` one step using the `findNextIndex` function
	
	   - Move `fast` one step using the `findNextIndex` function
	   - If `fast` is not `-1`, move `fast` another step using the `findNextIndex` function
	
	   - Continue this loop until `slow` and `fast` pointers meet or one of them becomes `-1`

##### 5. **Check for Cycle**:

   - If `slow` and `fast` pointers meet (and neither is `-1`), a cycle is detected
   - Return `true` indicating a cycle is found

##### 6. **Mark Visited Indices**:

   - If no cycle is found, mark all indices visited during this cycle detection attempt
	   - Initialize `index` to `startIndex`.
	
	   - While `index` is not `-1` and not already visited
		   - Mark `visited[index]` as `true`
		   - Move `index` to the next index using the `findNextIndex` function

##### 7. Return Result:

   - - If no cycle is detected for any index, return `false`.


``` run-csharp
public bool loopExists(int[] nums)
{
	bool[] visited = new bool[nums.Length];
	
	for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)
	{
		if(visited[i])
			continue;
		
		bool isForward = nums[i] >= 0;
		int slow = i, fast = i;
		
		do
		{
			slow = FindNextIndex(num, isForward, slow);
			fast = FindNextIndex(num, isForward, fast);
			
			if(fast != -1)
			{
				fast = FindNextIndex(num, isForward, fast);
			}
		} while (slow != -1 && fast != -1 && slow != fast);
		
		if(slow != -1 && slow == fast)
			return true;
	}
	
	return false;
}
```

``` run-csharp
private int FindNextIndex(int[] nums, bool isForward, int index)
{
	bool direction = nums[index] >= 0;
	if(isForward != direction)
		return -1;
	
	int nextIndex = (index + nums[index]) % nums.Length;
	
	if(nextIndex < 0)
		nextIndex += nums.Length
	
	if(nextIndex == index)
		nextIndex = -1;
		
	return nextIndex;
}
```
