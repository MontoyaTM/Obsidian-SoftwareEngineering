In C#, merging <font style="color:#81fd83">sorted arrays</font> involves combining two or more sorted arrays into a single sorted array. The resulting array contains all the elements from the input arrays, arranged in ascending order.


> [!success]
>  - Assume the arrays are not of same size: while i or j is less than the length of the array 
>  - Loop through both arrays to compare the first values of each array: i or j. Find the lower of the two and insert them into a separate array: k, of size array1 + array2. 
>  - Loop through remaining arrays and insert them at the end of the newly created array

``` run-csharp
public int[] MergeSortedArray(int[] array1, int[] array2)
{
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;

    int totalLength = array1.Length + array2.Length;
    int[] temp = new int[totalLength];

    while(i < array1.Length &&  j < array2.Length)
    {
        if (array1[i] >= array2[j])
        {
            temp[k++] = array2[j++];
        } 
        else 
        {
            temp[k++] = array1[i++];
        }
    }

    while(i <  array1.Length)
    {
        temp[k++] = array1[i++];
    }

    while(j < array2.Length)
    {
        temp[k++]= array2[j++];
    }

    return temp;
}
```
