>  # Shortest Word Distance

Given an array of strings `words` and two different strings that already exist in the array `word1` and `word2`, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

> ## Solution 

To find the shortest distance between two given words, we can iterate through the list of words and use two pointers to track the positions of these words. 

Whenever we find one of these words in the list, we will update the word's position and calculate the distance from the other word. This way, we will keep track of the shortest distance between the two words.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm

#### 1. Initialize two variables

   - Initialize variables `pos1` and `pos2` to `-1`  to store the position of `word1` and `word2`  

``` run-csharp
public int shortestDistance(int[] nums, string word1, string word2)
	int pos1 = -1, pos2 = -1;
```

#### 2. Initialize distance

   - Initialize a variable `shortestDistance` with the length of the words list as the initial value. This value will be updated later in the loop as the shortest distance is found.

``` run-csharp
	int shortestDistance = nums.Length - 1;
```

#### 3. **Iterate through the Array:**

   - Loop through the words list and for each word, check if it is `word1` or `word2`. 
   - If it is `word1`, update `position1` with the current index. 
   - If it is `word2`, update `position2` with the current index.
   - If both `position1` and `position2` have been updated, that means both `word1` and `word2` have been found in the words list.
	   - In this case, update the `shortestDistance` with the absolute difference of the positions of `word1` and `word2`.

``` run-csharp
	for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)
	{
		if(nums[i] == word1)
		{
			pos1 = i;
		}
		if(nums[i] == word2)
		{
			pos2 = i;
		}
		if(pos1 != -1 && pos2 != -1)
		{
			shortestDistance = Math.Min(shortestDistance, Math.Abs(pos2 - pos1));
		}
	}
```

``` run-csharp
public int ShortestDistance(string[] words, string word1, string word2)
{
	int pos1 = -1, pos2 = -1;
	int distance = words.Length;

	for(int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++)
	{
		string word = words[i];
		
		if(word == word1)
		{
			pos1 = i;
		}
		
		if(word == word2)
		{
			pos2 = i;
		}

		if(pos1 != 1 && pos2 != -1)
		{
			distance = Math.Min(distance, Math.Abs(pos1 - pos2));
		}
	}
	return distance;
}
```
