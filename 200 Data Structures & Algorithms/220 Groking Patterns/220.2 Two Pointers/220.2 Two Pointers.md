In problems where we deal with sorted arrays (or linked-lists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, the Two Pointers approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or even a subarray.

**Given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.**

To solve this problem, we can consider each element one by one (indicated by the first pointer) and iterate through the remaining elements (indicated by the second pointer) to find a pair with the given sum. The time complexity of this algorithm will beÂ O(n^2), where 'N' is the number of elements in the input array.

Given that the input array is sorted, an efficient approach would be to start with one pointer at the beginning and another pointer at the end. At every step, we will check if the numbers indicated by the two pointers add up to the target sum.
