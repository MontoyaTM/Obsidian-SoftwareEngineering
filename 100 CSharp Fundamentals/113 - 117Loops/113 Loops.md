n C#, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. They are essential for automating <font style="color:#b562f9">repetitive</font> tasks and iterating over collections of data. C# provides several loop structures, including the <font style="color:#b562f9">for</font> loop, <font style="color:#b562f9">while</font> loop, <font style="color:#b562f9">do-while</font> loop, and <font style="color:#b562f9">foreach</font> loop. Let's go through each of them.

## Loop Control Statements:

Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

C# provides the following control statements.

> [!attention] 
> Break;
> 
> Terminates the **loop** or **switch** statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.


> [!attention] 
> Continue;
> 
> Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
