A constructor having at least one <font style="color:#b562f9">parameter</font> is called as parameterized constructor. It can initialize each instance of the class to different values.

``` run-csharp
class Geek {

    String name;
    int id;
 
    Geek(String name, int id)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }
}

Geek geek1 = new Geek("GFG", 1);
        
Console.WriteLine("GeekName = " + geek1.name + " and GeekId = " + geek1.id);
```
