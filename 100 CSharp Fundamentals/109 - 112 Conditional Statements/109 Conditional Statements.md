>  # Conditional Statements

Conditional statements in programming are used to make <font style="color:#b562f9">decisions</font> and execute different blocks of code based on certain <font style="color:#b562f9">conditions</font> or expressions. These statements allow the program to follow different paths of execution depending on the evaluation of the specified conditions.
