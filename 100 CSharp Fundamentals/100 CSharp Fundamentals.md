# C# Fundamentals

#### 1. Syntax: 

C# has a syntax that is similar to other programming languages like Java and C++, so if you have experience with those languages, you should find C# easy to learn. The syntax includes <font style="color:#b562f9">statements</font>, <font style="color:#b562f9">expressions</font>, and <font style="color:#b562f9">operators</font>.

#### 2. Data Type: 

C# has several built-in [[101 Data Type | data types]], including <font style="color:#b562f9">integer</font>, <font style="color:#b562f9">floating-point</font>, <font style="color:#b562f9">character</font>, and <font style="color:#b562f9">Boolean</font>. Understanding how to use these data types is essential for writing effective C# code.


#### 3. Variables: 

In C#, variables are used to <font style="color:#b562f9">store data</font>. To declare a variable, you need to specify its <font style="color:#b562f9">data type</font> and <font style="color:#b562f9">name</font>. You can then assign a value to the variable.<font style="color:#228a05"></font>

#### 4. Control Structures: 

Control structures are used to control the flow of a program. C# has several control structures, including <font style="color:#b562f9">if/else</font> statements, <font style="color:#b562f9">switch</font> statements, and <font style="color:#b562f9">loops</font> (<font style="color:#b562f9">for</font>, <font style="color:#b562f9">while</font>, and <font style="color:#b562f9">do-while</font>).

#### 5. Methods: 

Methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task. In C#, you can create your own methods or use built-in methods provided by the language.

#### 6. Classes and Objects: 

C# is an object-oriented language, which means that you can create classes and objects to represent real-world entities. A <font style="color:#b562f9">class</font> is a <font style="color:#b562f9">blueprint</font> for an <font style="color:#81fd83">object</font>, and an <font style="color:#b562f9">object</font> is an <font style="color:#b562f9">instance</font> of a <font style="color:#81fd83">class</font>.

#### 7. Inheritance: 
Inheritance is a key feature of object-oriented programming that allows you to create new classes based on existing classes. This helps you to reuse code and make your programs more modular.

#### 8. Exception Handling: 

Exception handling is the process of handling errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of a program. C# provides several ways to handle exceptions, including try-catch blocks.

#### 9. Libraries: 

C# provides access to a wide range of libraries and frameworks that you can use to build your applications more quickly and easily. These libraries include the .NET Framework and third-party libraries like ASP.NET and Unity.
