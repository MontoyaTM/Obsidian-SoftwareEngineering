>  # Delegate:

A <font style="color:#b562f9">Delegate</font> is a data structure that refers to a <font style="color:#b562f9">static method</font> or to a <font style="color:#b562f9">class instance</font> and an instance method of that class. It provides a way which tells which method is to be called when an event is triggered.

For example, if you <font style="color:#81fd83">click</font> on a <font style="color:#81fd83">Button</font> on a form (Windows Form application), the program would call a specific method. In simple words, it is a type that represents references to <font style="color:#81fd83">methods</font> with a particular parameter list and return type and then calls the method in a program for execution when it is needed.

# Singlecast Delegate Declaration:

Delegate type can be declared using the <font style="color:#b562f9">delegate</font> keyword. Once a delegate is declared, delegate <font style="color:#81fd83">instance</font> will refer and call those <font style="color:#81fd83">methods</font> whose <font style="color:#81fd83">return type</font> and <font style="color:#81fd83">parameter-list</font> matches with the delegate declaration.

``` run-csharp
// [modifier] delegate [return_type] [delegate_name] ([parameter_list]);

public delegate int GeeksForGeeks(int G, int F, int G);
```

# Singlecast Delegate Invocation:

After declaring a delegate, a delegate object is created with the help of **new** keyword. Once a delegate is <font style="color:#81fd83">instantiated</font>, a <font style="color:#81fd83">method call</font> made to the delegate is <font style="color:#81fd83">pass by the delegate</font> to that method. The <font style="color:#81fd83">parameters</font> passed to the delegate by the caller are passed to the method, and the <font style="color:#81fd83">return</font> value, if any, from the method, is <font style="color:#81fd83">returned to the caller</font> by the <font style="color:#81fd83">delegate</font>.

``` run-csharp
GeeksForGeeks GFG = new GeeksForGeeks (Geeks);
       // here,
       // "GeeksForGeeks" is delegate name. 
       // "GFG" is instance_name
       // "Geeks" is the calling method.
```

``` run-csharp
delegate void MyDelegate(string message);

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create an instance of the delegate
        MyDelegate myDelegate = new MyDelegate(PrintMessage);

        // Invoke the delegate
        myDelegate("Hello, delegates!");

        // Assign a different method to the delegate
        myDelegate = new MyDelegate(PrintUpperCaseMessage);

        // Invoke the delegate with a different method
        myDelegate("Hello, delegates with uppercase!");

        // You can also use the delegate's Invoke method
        myDelegate.Invoke("Hello, delegates using Invoke method!");
    }

    static void PrintMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }

    static void PrintUpperCaseMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message.ToUpper());
    }
}

```

# Multicasting of a Delegate:

When a delegate is <font style="color:#b562f9">wrapped</font> with more than one method, that is known as a multicast delegate. In C#, delegates are <font style="color:#b562f9">multicast</font>, meaning they can point to more than one function at a time. 

#### Properties:

-   Delegates are combined and when you call a delegate then a complete list of methods is called.
-   All methods are called in First in First Out(FIFO) order.
-   ‘+’ or ‘+=’ Operator is used to add the methods to delegates.
-   ‘–’ or ‘-=’ Operator is used to remove the methods from the delegates list.

Multicasting of delegate should have a <font style="color:#b562f9">return</font> type of <font style="color:#b562f9">Void</font> otherwise it will throw a <font style="color:#b562f9">runtime exception</font>. Also, the multicasting of delegate will return the value only from the last method added in the multicast.

``` run-csharp
namespace Delegates
{
    delegate void ArithmeticOperation(double operand1, double operand2);

    class Program
    {
        static void Addition(double number1, double number2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{number1} + {number2} = {number1 + number2}");
        }

        static void Subtraction(double number1, double number2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{number1} - {number2} = {number1 - number2}");
        }

        static void Multiplication(double number1, double number2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{number1} * {number2} = {number1 * number2}");
        }

        static void Division(double number1, double number2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{number1} / {number2} = {number1 / number2}");
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            ArithmeticOperation operations = Addition;
            operations += Subtraction;
            operations += Multiplication;
            operations += Division;
            operations(10, 5);
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
```

# Anonymous Delegate:

As the name suggests, an anonymous method is a method without a name. Anonymous methods in C# can be defined using the <font style="color:#b562f9">delegate</font> keyword and can be assigned to a variable of delegate type.


``` run-csharp
public delegate void Print(int value);

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Print print = delegate(int val) { 
        Console.WriteLine("Inside Anonymous method. Value: {0}", val); 
    };

    print(100);
}
```

``` run-csharp
public delegate bool FilterDelegate(Person p);

class Person
{
	FilterDelegate filter = delegate(Person p) 
	{
		return p.Age >= 20 && p.Age <= 30;
	}
}

```

Anonymous methods can be used as event handlers:

``` run-csharp
saveButton.Click += delegate(Object o, EventArgs e)
{ 
    System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show("Save Successfully!"); 
};
```

>  # Use Case:

1.  <font style="color:#b562f9">Event Handling</font>: Delegates can be used to handle events in your application. For example, you might create a delegate to handle button clicks in a UI, or to handle network events in a network library.

2.  <font style="color:#b562f9">Callbacks</font>: Delegates can be used to implement callbacks in your application. For example, you might create a delegate that is called when a long-running operation completes.

3.  <font style="color:#b562f9">LINQ Queries</font>: Delegates can be used in LINQ queries to filter and transform data. For example, you might use a delegate to filter a list of products based on their price.

4.  <font style="color:#b562f9">Asynchronous Programming</font>: Delegates can be used to implement asynchronous programming patterns, such as the <font style="color:#81fd83">async/await pattern</font>. For example, you might use a delegate to represent an asynchronous method that is called when an operation completes.

5.  <font style="color:#b562f9">Dependency Injection</font>: Delegates can be used with dependency injection frameworks to inject dependencies into objects in your application. For example, you might use a delegate to represent a factory method that creates instances of a particular type.
