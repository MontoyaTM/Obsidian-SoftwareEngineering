In C#, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type that are stored in contiguous memory locations and accessed by their index or position within the collection.

Arrays in C# are <font style="color:#b562f9">fixed-size</font> structures, which means that once an array is <font style="color:#b562f9">created</font>, its size cannot be changed. The size of an array is specified when the array is declared, and the size cannot be changed thereafter.

# Array Declaration

An array can be declared using by specifying the type of its elements with square brackets.

``` run-csharp
int [] evenNums;
string[] cities;
```

``` run-csharp
int [] evenNums = new int[] {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}; string[] 
cities = new string[3] {"Mumbai", "London", "New York"};
```

``` run-csharp
int [] evenNums = new int[] {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}; 
string[] cities = new string[] {"Mumbai", "London", "New York"};
```

``` run-csharp
int [] evenNums = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}; 
string[] cities = {"Mumbai", "London", "New York"};
```

> [!example] 
>  ### Code Snippet:

The code below will display the items in the Array.

``` run-csharp
int [] evenNums = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}; 
string[] cities  = {"Mumbai", "London", "New York"};

foreach(int even in evenNums) {
	Console.WriteLine(even);
}

for(int i = 0; i < cities.Length; i++) {
	Console.WriteLine(cities[i]);
}
```
