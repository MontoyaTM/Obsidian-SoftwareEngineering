In c#, <font style="color:#b562f9">Object</font> is an <font style="color:#81fd83">instance</font> of a <font style="color:#81fd83">class</font> that can be used to access the data members and member functions of a **class**. An object consists of :

- <font style="color:#b562f9">State</font>: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.

- <font style="color:#b562f9">Behavior</font>: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.

- <font style="color:#b562f9">Identity</font>: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

# Object Instantiation:

In C#, an object of a class can be instantiated using the <font style="color:#b562f9">new</font> keyword and assign that object to a variable of a class type. All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class. But the values of those attributes, i.e. the state are unique for each object.


``` run-csharp
class Student
{
	public Student() 
	{
		// Constructor
	}
}

Student myStudent = new Student();
```

``` run-csharp
// C# program to illustrate the
// Initialization of an object
using System;
 
// Class Declaration
public class Dog {
 
    // Instance Variables
    String name;
    String breed;
    int age;
    String color;
 
    // Constructor Declaration of Class
    public Dog(String name, String breed,
                  int age, String color)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.breed = breed;
        this.age = age;
        this.color = color;
    }
 
    // Property 1
    public String GetName()
    {
        return name;
    }
 
    // Property 2
    public String GetBreed()
    {
        return breed;
    }
 
    // Property 3
    public int GetAge()
    {
        return age;
    }
 
    // Property 4
    public String GetColor()
    {
        return color;
    }
 
    // Method 1
    public String ToString()
    {
        return ("Hi my name is " + this.GetName()
                + ".\nMy breed, age and color are " + this.GetBreed()
                + ", " + this.GetAge() + ", " + this.GetColor());
    }
 
// Main Method
public static void Main(String[] args)
    {
         
        // Creating object
        Dog tuffy = new Dog("tuffy", "papillon", 5, "white");
        Console.WriteLine(tuffy.ToString());
    }
}
```

>  # Use Case:

1.  <font style="color:#b562f9">Data Storage</font>: Objects can be used to store data and represent real-world entities in your application. For example, you might create a `Person` class and create objects from that class to represent individual people.

2.  <font style="color:#b562f9">Interaction</font> with <font style="color:#b562f9">APIs</font>: Objects can be used to interact with APIs and other external services in your application. For example, you might create an object that represents a user's account on a social media platform and use that object to interact with the platform's API.

3.  <font style="color:#b562f9">Customization</font>: Objects can be used to customize the behavior of a system or framework. For example, you might create an object that implements a custom authentication scheme for your application.

4.  <font style="color:#b562f9">Event Handling</font>: Objects can be used to handle events in your application. For example, you might create an object that listens for mouse clicks and performs an action when the mouse is clicked.

5.  <font style="color:#b562f9">Dependency Injection</font>: Objects can be used with dependency injection frameworks to inject dependencies into other objects in your application. For example, you might use an object to represent a database connection and inject that object into a repository class that accesses the database.
