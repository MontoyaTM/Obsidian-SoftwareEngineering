>  # Method Overriding

<font style="color:#b562f9">Method overriding</font> in C# is a feature that allows a <font style="color:#b562f9">derived class</font> to provide its own <font style="color:#b562f9">implementation</font> of a <font style="color:#b562f9">method</font> that is already defined in its <font style="color:#b562f9">base class</font>. It enables a derived class to modify or extend the behavior of an inherited method from the base class.

> [!example] 
> ## Method Overriding Declaration

 For overriding the base class method in a derived class, you have to declare a <font style="color:#81fd83">base class</font> method as <font style="color:#b562f9">virtual</font> and <font style="color:#81fd83">derived class</font> method as <font style="color:#b562f9">override</font>. To override a method in C#, the derived class must have the <font style="color:#b562f9">same method signature</font> (<font style="color:#81fd83">name</font>, <font style="color:#81fd83">return type</font>, and <font style="color:#81fd83">parameter</font> list) as the base class method. 

``` run-csharp
class Shape
{
	public virtual void Draw()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Drawing a shape.");
	}
}

class Circle : Shape
{
	public override void Draw()
	{
		Console.WriteLine(Drawing a circle.);
	}
}


class Program
{
	Shape shape = new Shape();
	Shape circle = new Circle();

	shape.Draw()
	circle.Draw();
}
```

> [!example] 
> #### Customizing Behavior 

Method overriding allows derived classes to provide their <font style="color:#b562f9">own implementation</font> of a base class method, enabling customization and modification of the behavior to suit the specific needs of the derived class.

> [!example] 
> #### Polymorphism 

Method overriding is a key feature for achieving polymorphism in <font style="color:#b562f9">object-oriented programming</font>. It allows objects of different derived classes to be <font style="color:#81fd83">treated uniformly</font> as instances of their common base class, while invoking the appropriate overridden method based on the actual object type.

> [!example] 
> #### Template Method Design Pattern

Method overriding is a fundamental concept in the <font style="color:#b562f9">Template Method</font> design pattern. The base class defines a template method with certain steps or algorithms, and derived classes override specific steps to provide their own implementation, allowing customization of the overall algorithm.
