> [!note] 
>  # Cyclic Sort

We are given an array containing `n` objects. Each object, when created, was assigned a unique number from the range `1` to `n` based on their creation sequence. This means that the object with sequence number `3` was created just before the object with sequence number `4`.

Write a function to sort the objects in-place on their creation sequence number in  without using any extra space. For simplicity, let’s assume we are passed an integer array containing only the sequence numbers, though each number is actually an object.

> ## Solution 

To place a number (or an object in general) at its correct index, we first need to find that number. 
   - If we first find a number and then place it at its correct place, it will take us , which is not acceptable as mentioned in the problem statement.

Instead, what if we iterate the array one number at a time, and if the current number we are iterating is not at the correct index, we swap it with the number at its correct index. This way, we will go through all numbers and place them at their correct indices, hence, sorting the whole array.

``` run-csharp
public int[] sort(int[] nums)
{
	int i = 0;
	
	while(i < nums.Length)
	{
		int j = nums[i] - 1;
		
		if(nums[i] != nums[j])
			Swap(nums, i, j);
		else
			i++;
	}
	return nums;
}
```

``` run-csharp
private void Swap(int[] nums, int i, int j)
{
	int temp = nums[i];
	nums[i] = nums[j];
	nums[j] = temp;
}
```
