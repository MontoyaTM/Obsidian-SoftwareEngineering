>  # Cyclic Sort

Cycle sort is an in-place sorting algorithm. This pattern describes an interesting approach to dealing with problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range.

- It is optimal in terms of the number of memory writes.
- It is based on the idea that the array to be sorted can be divided into cycles. Cycles can be visualized as a graph.


**The principal idea:**Â Given an element a, we can find the index at which it will occur in the sorted list by simply counting the number of elements in the entire list that are smaller than a.
