>  # Good Numbers

Any number will be called a happy number if, after repeatedly replacing it with a number equal to the **sum of the square of all of its digits, leads us to the number `1`. All other (not-happy) numbers will never reach `1`**. Instead, they will be stuck in a cycle of numbers that does not include `1`.

Given a positive number `n`, return `true` if it is a happy number otherwise return `false`.

> ## Solution 

The process, defined above, to find out if a number is a happy number or not, always ends in a cycle. If the number is a happy number, the process will be stuck in a cycle on number ‘1,’ and if the number is not a happy number then the process will be stuck in a cycle with a set of numbers.

   - As we saw in Example-2 while determining if ‘12’ is a happy number or not, our process will get stuck in a cycle with the following numbers:

	   - 89 -> 145 -> 42 -> 20 -> 4 -> 16 -> 37 -> 58 -> 89


We saw in the LinkedList Cycle problem that we can use the Fast & Slow pointers method to find a cycle among a set of elements. As we have described above, each number will definitely have a cycle.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm




> [!example] 
>  ## Code Snippet

``` run-csharp
public bool isGoodNumber(int num)
{
	int slow = num;
	int fast = num;
	
	do
	{
		slow = FindSquareSum(slow);
		fast = FindSquareSum(FindSquareSum(fast));
	} while(slow != fast);

	return slow == 1;
}
```

``` run-csharp
public int FindSqaureSum(int num)
{
	int sum = 0,  digit;
	
	while(num > 0)
	{
		digit = num % 10;
		sum += digit * digit;
		num /= 10;
	}
	
	return sum;
}
```
