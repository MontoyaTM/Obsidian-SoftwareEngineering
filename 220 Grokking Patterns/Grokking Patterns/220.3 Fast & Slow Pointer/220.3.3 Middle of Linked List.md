>  # Middle of Linked List

Given the head of a **Singly LinkedList**, write a method to return the **middle node** of the LinkedList.

If the total number of nodes in the LinkedList is even, return the second middle node.

One brute force strategy could be to first count the number of nodes in the LinkedList and then find the middle node in the second iteration. Can we do this in one iteration?

   - We can use the **Fast & Slow pointers** method such that the fast pointer is always twice the nodes ahead of the slow pointer.

``` run-csharp
public Node findMiddle(Node head)
{
	Node slow = head;
	Node fast = head;
	
	while(fast != null && fast.next!= null)
	{
		fast = fast.next.next;
		slow = slow.next;
	}
	
	return slow;
}
```
