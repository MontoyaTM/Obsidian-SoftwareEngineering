We can use a similar approach to the Linked List Cycle problem. Once the fast and slow pointers meet, we can save the slow pointer and iterate the whole cycle with another pointer until we see the slow pointer again to find the length of the cycle.

``` run-csharp
public int cycleLength(Node head)
{
	Node slow = head;
	Node fast = head;
	
	while(fast != null && fast.next != null)
	{
		fast = fast.Next.next;
		slow = fast.Next;
		
		if(slow == fast)
		{
			return calculateLength(slow);
		}
	}
	
	retunr 0;
}
```

``` run-csharp
private int calculateLength(Node slow)
{
	Node current = slow;
	int length = 0;
	
	do
	{
		current = current.Next;
		length++;
	} while(current != slow);
	
	return length;
}
```
