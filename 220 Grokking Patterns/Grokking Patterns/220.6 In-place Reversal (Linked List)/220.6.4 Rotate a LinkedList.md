>  # Rotate a LinkedList

Given the head of a Singly LinkedList and a number ‘k’, rotate the LinkedList to the right by ‘k’ nodes.

> ## Solution 

Another way of defining the rotation is to take the sub-list of ‘k’ ending nodes of the LinkedList and connect them to the beginning. Other than that we have to do three more things:

1. Connect the last node of the LinkedList to the head, because the list will have a different tail after the rotation.
   
2. The new head of the LinkedList will be the node at the beginning of the sublist.
   
3. The node right before the start of sub-list will be the new tail of the rotated LinkedList.

``` run-csharp
public class Node
{
	public int data = 0;
	public Node next;
	
	public Node(int data)
	{
		this.data = data;
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public Node rotate(Node head, int rotations)
{
	if(head == null || head.Next == null || rotations <= 0)
		return head;
	
	Node lastNode = head;
	int length = 1;
	
	while(lastNode.next != null)
	{
		lastNode = lastNode.next;
		length++;
	}
	
	lastNode.next = head;
	rotations %= length;
	
	int skipLength = length - rotations;
	Node rotated_lastNode = head;
	
	for(int i = 0; i < skipLength - 1; i++)
		rotated_lastNode = rotated_lastNode.next;
	
	head = rotated_lastNode.next;
	rotated_lastNode.next = null;
	
	return head;
}
```
