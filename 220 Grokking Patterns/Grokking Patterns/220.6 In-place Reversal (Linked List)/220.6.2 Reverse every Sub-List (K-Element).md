>  # Reverse every Sub-List (K-Element)

Given the head of a LinkedList and a number ‘k’, **reverse every ‘k’ sized sub-list starting from the head**.

If, in the end, you are left with a sub-list with less than ‘k’ elements, reverse it too.

> ## Solution 

The problem follows the **In-place Reversal of a LinkedList** pattern and is quite similar to `Reverse a Sub-list`. 

The only difference is that we have to reverse all the sub-lists. We can use the same approach, starting with the first sub-list (i.e. `p=1`, `q=k`) and keep reversing all the sublists of size ‘k’.

``` run-csharp
public class Node
{
	public int data = 0;
	public Node next;
	
	public Node(int data)
	{
		this.data = data;
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public Node reverse(Node head, int k)
{
	if(k <= 1 || head == null)
		return head;
	
	Node node = head;
	Node prev = null;
	
	while(true)
	{
		Node prevSegment = prev;
		Node lastNode = node;
		Node next = null;
		
		for(int i = 0; node != null && i < k; i++)
		{
			next = node.next;
			node.next = prev'
			prev = node;
			node = next;
		}
		
		if(prevSegment != null)
			prevSegment.next = prev;
		else
			head = prev;
		
		lastNode.next = node;
		
		if(node == null)
			break;
			
		prev = lastNode;
	}
	
	return head;
}
```
