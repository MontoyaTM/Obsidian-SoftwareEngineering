>  # In-place Reversal of a Linked List

In a lot of problems, we are asked to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a **LinkedList**. Often, the constraint is that we need to do this in-place, i.e., using the existing node objects and without using extra memory.

   - **In-place Reversal of a LinkedList** pattern describes an efficient way to solve the above problem.
