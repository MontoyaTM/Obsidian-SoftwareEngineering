>  # Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** in it **with no more than K distinct characters**.

You can assume that K is less than or equal to the length of the given string.

> ## Solution 

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain a window that contains at most ( K ) distinct characters. 

   - We will expand the window by including one character at a time from the right, and once the window contains more than ( K ) distinct characters, we will shrink it from the left until it again contains ( K ) or fewer distinct characters.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm

##### 1. **Initialize Variables**:

   - `freq` to store the frequency of chars inside a Dictionary.
   - `maxLength` to store the maximum length value.
   - `j` to mark the start of the current window.

##### 2. **Iterate through the array**:

Use a `for` loop where `i` goes from `0` to the end of the array.

   - Increment the character frequency at `char[i]` 

##### 3. Check if Dictionary greater than target

If the Dictionary contains more than `target` distinct characters:

   - Remove characters from the left (i.e., move `j` to the right) until the Dictionary contains at most `target` distinct characters.
   - Decrease the frequency of the leftmost character and remove it from the Dictionary if its frequency becomes zero.

##### 4. Update length

   - Update the maximum length of the substring found so far.

>  ## Code Snippet


``` run-csharp
public int findLength(int target, string str)  
{    
	Dictionary<char, int> freq = new Dictionary<char, int>();
	int maxLength = 0, j = 0;
	
	for(int i = 0; i < str.Length; i++)
	{
		freq[str[i]] = freq.GetValueOrDefault(str[i], 0) + 1;
		
		while(freq.Count > target)
		{
			freq[str[j]] = freq.GetValueOrDefault(str[j], 0) - 1;
			
			if(freq[str[j]] == 0)
			{
				freq.Remove(str[j]);
			}
			j++;
		}
		maxLength = Math.Max(maxLength, i - j + 1);
	}                            
	return maxLength;  
}
```

>  # Fruits into Baskets

You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees. You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.

You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. The farm has following restrictions:

   - Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
   - You can start with any tree, but you can’t skip a tree once you have started.
   - You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
