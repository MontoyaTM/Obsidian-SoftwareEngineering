>  # Longest Substring with Same Letters after Replacement

Given a string with lowercase letters only, if you are allowed to **replace no more than ‘k’ letters** with any letter, find the **length of the longest substring having the same letters** after replacement.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a window that can contain up to `k` characters that are different from the most frequent character in the current window. By doing so, we maximize the length of the window while keeping the number of changes within the allowed limit.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm

##### 1. Initialize Variables:

   - Start a window `j` at the beginning of the string
   - Set `maxLength` to 0 to keep track of the longest valid substring
   - Use `maxRepeatable` to store the count of the most frequent character in the current window
   - Use a Dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each character in the current window

##### 2. Expand Window:

   - Iterate through the string using a loop with `i` ranging from 0 to the length of the string
   - Add the character at `i` to the Dictionary and update its frequency
   - Update `maxRepeatable` to be the maximum frequency of any character in the current window

##### 3. Shrink the Window if Necessary:

   - If the number of characters that need to be replaced (`i - j + 1 - maxRepeatable`) exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the left by incrementing `j++`
   - Adjust the frequency of the character that is left out of the window by decrementing `str[j]`.

##### 4. Update the Maximum Length:

   - Calculate the current window size and update `maxLength` if the current window size is larger

##### 5. Return the Result:

   - After the loop, `maxLength` will hold the length of the longest substring where up to `k` characters can be replaced to make all characters the same

``` run-csharp
public int findLength(string str, int k)
{
	Dictionary<char, int> freq = new Dictionary<char, int>();
	int maxLength = 0, maxRepeatable = 0, j = 0;
	
	for(int i = 0; i < str.Length; i++)
	{
		freq[str[i]] = freq.GetValueOrDefault(str[i], 0) + 1;
		maxRepeatable = Math.Max(maxRepeatable, freq[str[i]]);
		
		if(i - j + 1 - maxRepeatable > k)
		{
			freq[str[j]]--;
			j++;
		}
		
		maxLength = Math.Max(maxLength, i - j + 1);
	}
	
	return maxLength;
}
```
