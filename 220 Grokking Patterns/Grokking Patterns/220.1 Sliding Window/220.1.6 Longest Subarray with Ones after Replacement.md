>  # Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement

Given an array containing 0s and 1s, if you are allowed to **replace no more than ‘k’ 0s with 1s**, find the length of the **longest contiguous subarray having all 1s**.

> ## Solution 

This problem follows the **Sliding Window** pattern and is quite similar to Longest Substring with same Letters after Replacement. The only difference is that, in the problem, we only have two characters (1s and 0s) in the input arrays.

Following a similar approach, we’ll iterate through the array to add one number at a time in the window. We’ll also keep track of the maximum number of repeating 1s in the current window (let’s call it `maxOnesCount`).

   - So at any time, we know that we can have a window with 1s repeating `maxOnesCount` time, so we should try to replace the remaining 0s.
   - If we have more than ‘k’ remaining 0s, we should shrink the window as we are not allowed to replace more than ‘k’ 0s.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm


##### 1. Initialize Variables:

   - Start a window `j` at the beginning of the string
   - Set `maxLength` to 0 to keep track of the longest valid substring
   - Use `maxOneCount` to store the count of `1s`

##### 2. Expand Window:

   - Iterate through the string using a loop with `i` ranging from 0 to the length of the string
   - If the current element is 1, increment `maxOnesCount`

##### 3. Shrink the Window if Necessary:

   - If the number of characters that need to be replaced (`i - j + 1 - maxOneCount`) exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the left by incrementing `j++`
   - Adjust the frequency of the character that is left out of the window by decrementing `nums[j]`.

##### 4. Update the Maximum Length:

   - Calculate the current window size and update `maxLength` if the current window size is larger

##### 5. Return the Result:

   - After the loop, `maxLength` will hold the length of the longest substring where up to `k` characters can be replaced to make all characters the same

>  ## Code Snippet

``` run-csharp
public int FindLength(int[] nums, int k)
{
	int maxLength = 0, maxOneCount = 0, j = 0;
	
	for(int i = 0; i < nums.Lengthh; i++)
	{
		if(nums[i] == 1)
			maxOneCount++;
		
		if(i - j + 1 - maxOneCount > k)
		{
			if(nums[j] == 1)
				maxOneCount--;
			j++;
		}
		
		maxLength = Math.Max(maxLength, i - j + 1);
	}
}
```
