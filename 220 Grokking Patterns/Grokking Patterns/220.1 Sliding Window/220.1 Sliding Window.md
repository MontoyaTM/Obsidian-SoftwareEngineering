>  # Sliding Window

The **Sliding Window Pattern** is a common algorithmic technique used to solve problems involving arrays, strings, or lists. It helps in reducing the time complexity by avoiding the need for nested loops. 
This pattern works by maintaining a "window" (a subset of the data) and sliding it over the input while performing calculations within that window.

### How the Sliding Window Pattern Works

1. **Define a window**: Typically a range of indices (or pointers) that represents a subset of the data.
2. **Expand the window**: Increase the size of the window as needed by adding new elements.
3. **Shrink the window**: Remove elements from the window that are no longer relevant.
4. **Track the result**: Maintain the best result based on the problem requirements (e.g., maximum, minimum, or specific count).
