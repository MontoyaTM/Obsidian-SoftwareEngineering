>  # Merge Intervals

Given a list of intervals, **merge all the overlapping intervals** to produce a list that has only mutually exclusive intervals.

Let’s take the example of two intervals (‘a’ and ‘b’) such that `a.start <= b.start`. There are four possible scenarios:

Our goal is to merge the intervals whenever they overlap. For the above-mentioned three overlapping scenarios (2, 3, and 4), this is how we will merge them:

To solve this problem, we will sort the list of intervals by their start times. This helps in easily identifying overlapping intervals. After sorting, we can iterate through the intervals, merging them if they overlap. We will maintain a list to store the merged intervals.

   - As we iterate, we compare the current interval with the last interval in the merged list. 
	   - If they overlap, we merge them by extending the end time. 
	   - Otherwise, we add the current interval to the merged list.


This approach works because sorting brings overlapping intervals next to each other. This allows us to handle overlapping intervals in a single pass through the list. Sorting the intervals first is key to simplifying the merging process.


## Step-by-Step Algorithm

##### 1. Sort Intervals

   - Begin by sorting the list of intervals based on their start times
   - This can be done using the comparator in Java

##### 2. Initialize Merged List:

   - Create an empty list called `mergedIntervals` to store the merged intervals

##### 3. Set Initial Interval:

   - Start by picking the first interval and set it as the current interval

##### 4. Iterate through Intervals:

   - Loop through the rest of the intervals

   - For each interval:

	   - Check Overlap
		   - If the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of the previous interval, it means they overlap.
		   - In this case, merge them by updating the end of the previous interval to be the maximum of both ends.

	   - Non-overlapping
		   - If they do not overlap, add the previous interval to the `mergedIntervals` list
		   - Update the current interval to be the next interval in the list

##### 5. Add Last Interval:

   - After the loop completes, add the last interval to the `mergedIntervals` list

##### 6. Return Result:

   - Return the `mergedInervals` list as the final output

``` run-csharp
public class Interval
{
	public int Start { get; set; }
	public int End { get; set; }
	
	public Interval(int start, int end)
	{
		this.Start = start;
		this.End = end;
	}	
}
```

``` run-csharp
public List<Interval> merge(List<Interval> intervals)
{
	if(intervals.Count < 2)
		return intervals;
	
	intervals.Sort((a, b) => a.Start.CompareTo(b.Start));
	
	List<Interval> mergedIntervals = new List<Interval>();
	
	IEnumerator<Interval> intervalItr = intervals.GetEnumerator();
	intervalItr.MoveNext();
	
	Interval interval = intervalItr.Current;
	
	int start = interval.Start;
	int end = interval.End;
	
	while(intervalItr.MoveNext())
	{
		interval = intervalItr.Current;
		
		if(interval.Start <= end)
		{
			end = Math.Max(interval.End, end);
		}
		else
		{
			mergedIntervals.Add(new Interval(start, end));
			start = interval.Start;
			end = interval.End;
		}
	}
	
	mergedIntervals.Add(new Interval(start, end));
	
	return mergedIntervals;

}
```
