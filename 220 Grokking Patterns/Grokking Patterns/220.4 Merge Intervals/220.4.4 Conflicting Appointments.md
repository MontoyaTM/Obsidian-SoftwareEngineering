> ## Solution 

The best way to do this is by first sorting the intervals based on their start times. Once sorted, we can then iterate through the list and compare each interval with the previous one to see if there is any overlap.

This approach works efficiently because by sorting the intervals, we ensure that if there is an overlap, it will be between consecutive intervals. This reduces the problem to a simpler check, making the solution both effective and easy to understand.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm

##### 1. Sorting:

   - Sort the intervals based on their start times. This ensure that we only need to compare each interval with the previous one.

##### 2. Iterate: 

   - Iterate through the sorted list of intervals.
   
   - For each interval from the second onward, compare its start tune with the end time of the previous interval.
	   - If the start time of the current intervals is less than the end time of the previous interval, `return false` because it means there is an overlap

   - If no overlaps are found during the iteration, `return true` indicating that all meetings can be attended without conflicts

>  ## Code Snippet

``` run-csharp
public bool canAttendAllAppointments(Interval[] intervals)
{
	Array.Sort(intervals, (a, b) => a.Start.CompareTo(b.Start));
	
	for(int i = 1; i < intervals.Length; i++)
	{
		if(intervals[i].Start < intervals[i - 1].End)
		{
			return false;
		}
	}
	return true;
}
```
