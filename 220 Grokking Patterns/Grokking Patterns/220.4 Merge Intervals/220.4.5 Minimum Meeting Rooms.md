>  # Minimum Meeting Rooms

Given a list of intervals representing the start and end time of ‘N’ meetings, find the **minimum number of rooms** required to **hold all the meetings**.

> ## Solution 

**Meetings**: `[[4,5], [2,3], [2,4], [3,5]]`

Start by sorting the meetings on their start time will give us:

Sorting: `[[2,3], [2,4], [3,5], [4,5]]`

Merge overlapping meetings will allow for more efficient algorithm to solve this problem. 

Since all the given meetings have merged into one big meeting `([2,5])`, does this mean that they all are overlapping and we need a minimum of four rooms to hold these meetings?

   - No!
   - As we can clearly see, some meetings are mutually exclusive. For example, `[2,3]` and `[3,5]` do not overlap and can happen in one room.

So, to correctly solve our problem, we need to keep track of the mutual exclusiveness of the overlapping meetings.

We can conclude that we need to **keep track of the ending time of all the meetings currently happening** so that when we try to schedule a new meeting, we can see what meetings have already ended.  

   - A `Min Heap` would fit our requirements best.


## Step-by-Step Algorithm

##### 1. Sort Meetings by start time:

   - Sort the list of meetings based on their start times. This helps in processing meetings in the order they begin.

##### 2. Initialize Min Heap:

   - Create a priority queue `minHeap` to store the meeting intervals and sort them by end times of the meetings. 
   - This helps in efficiently finding the earliest ending meeting that can be replaced with a new meeting.

##### 3. Process each meeting:

   - Iterate through the sorted list of meetings.
   - For each meeting, check if the start time of the current meeting is greater than or equal to the earliest ending meeting in the `minHeap`.
	   - If yes, remove the earliest ending meeting from the `minHeap`, as the room can be reused.
   - Add the current meeting's end time to the `minHeap`

##### 4. Track maximum rooms:

   - Keep track of the maximum size of the heap during the iteration. This size represents the minimum number of rooms required, as it shows the maximum number of concurrent meetings

##### 5. Return the result:

   - Return the maximum size of the heap as the result

``` run-csharp
public class PriorityQueue<T>
{
	private List<T> _list;
	private readonly Comparer<T> _comparer;

	public PriorityQueue(Comparison<T> comparison)
	{
		_list = new List<T>();
		_comparer = Comparer<T>.Create(comparison);
	}

	public void Enqueue(T item)
	{
		_list.Add(item);
		_list.Sort(_comparer);
	}

	public T Dequeue()
	{
		var frontItem = _list[0];
		_list.RemoveAt(0);
		return frontItem;
	}

	public T Peek()
	{
		return _list[0];
	}

	public int Count
	{
		get { return _list.Count; }
	}
}
```

``` run-csharp
public class Meeting
{
	public int Start { get; set; }
	public int End { get; set; }
	
	public Meeting(int start, int end)
	{
		this.Start = start;
		this.End = end;
	}	
}
```

``` run-csharp
public int findMinRooms(List<Meeting> meetings)
{
	if(meetings == null || meetings.Count == 0)
		return 0;
	
	meetings.Sort((a,b) => a.Start.CompareTo(b.Start));
	
	int minRooms = 0;
	PriorityQueue<Meeting> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<Meeting>((a,b) => a.End.CompareTo(b.End));
	
	foreach(Meeting meeting in meetings)
	{
		while(minHeap.Count > 0 && meeting.Start >= minHeap.Peek().End)
			minHeap.Dequeue();
		
		minHeap.Enqueue(meeting);
		minRooms = Math.Max(minRooms, minHeap.Count);
	}
	
	return minRooms;
}
```
