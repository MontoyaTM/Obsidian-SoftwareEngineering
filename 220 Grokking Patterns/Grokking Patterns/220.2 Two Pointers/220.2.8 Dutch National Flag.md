>  # Dutch National Flag

Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we can’t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called **Dutch National Flag problem**.

> ## Solution 

We can use a **Two Pointers** approach while iterating through the array. Let’s say the two pointers are called `low` and `high` which are pointing to the first and the last element of the array respectively.

   - So while iterating, we will move all 0s before `low` and all 2s after `high` so that in the end, all 1s will be between `low` and `high`.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm

##### 1. Initialize Variables:

   - We start by initializing three variables: `low = 0`, `high = nums.Length - 1`, `i  = 0`. 
	   - `Low` is meant to keep track of the latest position where a 0 should be placed.
	   - `High` is meant to keep track of the latest position where a 2 should be placed

``` run-csharp
	int low = 0, high = nums.Length - 1; 
	
	for(int i = 0; i <= high;)
```

##### 2. Iterate through Array:

   - Create a loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `high`. In each iteration of the loop, we check the value of the array at the index `i`.

	   - If the value is 0, we swap the values at the indices `i` and `low`. We then increment both `i` and `low`, since we know that the new element at `low` is 0 (sorted in its correct place) and we can move to the next index. 

	   - If the value is 1, we do nothing other than increment `i`. 
		   - This is because we want 1s to be in the middle of the array.
	   
	   - If the value is 2, we swap the values at `i` and `high`. However, after the swap, we only decrement `high` without incrementing `i`.
		   - This is because the new value at index `i` (after the swap) could be 0, 1 or 2, and we need to check this value again in the next iteration.

``` run-csharp
	for(int i = 0; i <= high;) 
	{ 
		if(nums[i] == 0) 
		{ 
			Swap(nums, i, low); 
			i++; 
			low++; 
		} else if( nums[i] == 1) 
		{ 
			i++; 
		} 
		else 
		{ 
			Swap(nums, i, high); 
			high--; 
		}
	}
```

##### 3. Swap Function:

   - The `swap` function simply switches the values at two given indices in the array.

``` run-csharp
public void Swap(int[] nums, int i, int j)
{
	int temp = nums[i];
	nums[i] = nums[j];
	nums[j] = temp;
}
```


> [!example] 
>  ## Code Snippet


``` run-csharp
public int[] sort(int[] nums)
{
	int low = 0, high = nums.Length - 1;
	
	for(int i = 0;  i <= high;)
	{
		if(nums[i] == 0)
		{
			Swap(nums, i, low);
			i++;
			low++;
		}
		else if( nums[i] == 1)
		{
			i++;
		}
		else
		{
			Swap(nums, i, high);
			high--;
		}
	}
	
	return nums;
}
```


``` run-csharp
public void Swap(int[] nums, int i, int j)
{
	int temp = nums[i];
	nums[i] = nums[j];
	nums[j] = temp;
}
```
